Death's Nuts -- A by-necessity variation on the Embury Death's Comeback

1 Gin
1 St. Germain
1 Black Walnut Pi
1 lemon juice

Replacing the Aperol/Campari (both bitter Italian aperitif liqueurs) with
Black Walnut Pi results in a sweeter, nuttier drink.  The Pi imparts enough
bitterness to keep it more or less balanced, though.
