Grog (hot)

1-1/2 oz dark rum (try light?  Embury says "Jamaican"..)
1/2 oz lemon
1 tsp simple
3-4 oz hot water

Garnish: lemon twist.

First made with Mym and Chris during hot cocktails night (01-02-2013?)


01-23-2013: Spiced Variation:

1-1/2 oz dark rum (i did Gosling's Black Seal)
1/2 oz falernum
1/4 oz lime
3-4 oz hot water
cloves, cinnamon stick, star anise, and a lime squeeze to garnish

Tried this one on a whim 'cause i was frigging cold.  Tasty.  Still feels a
little too limey?  Originally tried 1/4 oz falernum, but that was definitely
not enough.  Maybe it just needs more water.  Hmm, that didn't help much.
Feel like it actually needs more falernum.  But i'm too wussy to try.  Anyway,
i need to play guitar..
