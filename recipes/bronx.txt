Bronx (from Cocktail)

1 gin
.5 sweet vermouth
.5 dry vermouth
1 orange juice

Garnish with maraschino cherry or an orange wheel.

Exact measurements are not required -- a little more of any ingredient will
bring it to the forefront, so feel free to adjust to the imbiber's preferences.

Matt liked it a lot -- this was his starting cocktail.  Reminded him of the
Leap Year.  I agreed, but thought it was a bit smoother -- not quite so harsh
of a finish, more pleasant.  When i made it, i poured the gin and the dry
vermouth with a heavy hand to produce a dry cocktail that emphasized the strong
juniper berry notes in the gin, Tanqueray.
