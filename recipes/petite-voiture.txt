Petite Voiture
(a Sidecar variation)

1-1/2 oz Cognac
3/4 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur
1/4 oz St. Germain

More nicely balanced than a plain ol' Sidecar.  A little too cognaccy still,
maybe.  Or perhaps just too lemony.  Could possibly go 1/2 oz lemon, 1/2 oz
St. Germain, a 3:1:1:1 ratio rather than a 6:3:2:1.  Then there would be less
cognac flavor (on account of less Domaine de Canton) and less lemon flavor.
