Strawberrye Manhattan

2 oz rye
1/2 oz sweet vermouth
2-3 strawberries
1 healthy dash rhubarb bitters

Muddle the strawberries in the bottom of the mixing tin, then pour in the
alcohol (including bitters, to taste).  Stir vigorously, and strain into a
rocks glass over ice (optionally use a cocktail glass instead?).

Garnish with a strawberry on the rim, with the leaves still on.

Made up 06-11-2012 for myself, using Trax Farms infinite strawberries.
Rhubarb bitters were a genius touch!  I used Russell's Reserve Rye, which
may have been a bit too strong -- i still don't really know what's up with
that stuff: too strong to drink straight, too strong to mix... but it worked
out after some dilution.

The final strawberry, after soaking in the whiskey: delicious!
