Martini (from Cocktail)

3 gin
.5 dry vermouth

Garnish with an olive.

Cocktail suggests the following preparation:
    "First, completely fill the mixing vessel with the freshest, coldest
    ice available.  [...]  Pour 1/2 ounce dry vermouth into the vessel in
    a circular motion, so that as much vermouth as possible touches the ice.
    Next, strain the vermouth from the container.  Whatever liquid stays on
    the surface of the ice will be enough for one or two Martinis."

Personally, i think it's better if you keep the vermouth rather than throwing
it out -- it makes for a mellower, smoother drink that melds better with the
brininess of the olive.  Try it with Bombay Sapphire for an even smoother
flavor experience.

"Officially", it should be stirred with the ice rather than shaken.  The
reason for this is that the ingredients are all clear, and part of the proper
presentation of a Martini is its crystal clarity -- shaking introduces many
bubbles and much cloudiness.  On the other hand, shaking makes it colder and
smoother due to slightly more dilution.  "Bruising the gin" is a crazy myth :P
