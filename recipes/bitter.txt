Bitter (aka "Herbal", afaic)

1.5 gin
.5 green Chartreuse
.5 lemon juice
dash Pernod

twist of lemon

Holy fuck this is amazing!  The melding of flavors, especially with the
essential oils from the lemon twist -- just ... beautiful.  The 4:1 ratio
of Chartreuse to Pernod really works -- they balance each other perfectly
without either jumping to the forefront.

A really amazing, herbal concoction.  Wonderful digestif.
