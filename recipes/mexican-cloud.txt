1-1/2 oz tequila
1 oz pomegranate juice
1 dash rhubarb bitters
1 dash simple syrup

Shake well.  Line a coupe with St. Germain foam and pour the shaken cocktail
into it.  [optional: fill in the hole.]  Garnish by flaming some Green
Chartreuse on top [or, lacking an atomizer, a flamed lemon peel].

04-30-2013: Made this at Chris's, sort of, because we wanted to hang out and
i wanted to make foam :)  Sort of, because i didn't have pomegranate juice, so
i just thought i'd use grenadine and forget about the simple, which probably
would have been fine, except that i accidentally brought the older grenadine,
and it'd apparently begun to ferment in the bottle, lending a certain not-
altogether-inoffensive funkiness and an exciting element of toxicity.


St. Germain Foam

4 egg whites
6 oz St. Germain
3 oz lemon juice
2 oz water

Pour all ingredients into a whipped creamer (e.g., iSi) and charge with N2O.
Jamie likes to double-charge, but a single charge seems to work.  Chill for
at least an hour before using, to let the foam stabilize.
