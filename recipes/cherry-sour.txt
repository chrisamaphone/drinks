Cherry Sour

2 oz gin
1 oz lemon
3/4 oz Cherry Heering
1/4 oz maraschino

05-26-2012: made this for Chris with newly acquired Cherry Heering.  Initially
tried just 1/2 oz Cherry Heering, but it was a little too dry, so i added 1/4
oz maraschino to sweeten it up a bit, but then it wasn't tart enough, so i added
another 1/4 oz Cherry Heering to attain the recipe above.  Perfect!  If a bit
big.

Chris thought it should be called a Sour Cherry, because it's more sour than
cherry.  That doesn't make sense, imho.
