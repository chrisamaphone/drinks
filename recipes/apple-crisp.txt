Apple Crisp

1-1/2 Calvados
1/2 Bittermen's Hiver Amere
1/4 lemon juice

Pretty heavy on the calvados -- good apple flavor, supported, i think, by the
other ingredients.  I also tried 3/4 hiver amere, but it was a little bit too
boozy then, oddly.  More cinnamon, but still not enough... maybe try adding
something else to bring out the cinnamon?
