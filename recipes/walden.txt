Walden (Cold Toddy)

2 oz bourbon
1 oz lemon
1/2 oz Averna
1/4 oz Allspice Dram
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca
barspoon honey

Serve in a rocks glass; garnish with a lemon peel.

Invented Monday, August 6th, 2012 at home, to use up some lemon and make
a whiskey drink.  Vaguely inspired by something custom i had at Meat and
Potatoes recently, that the bartender tongue-in-cheekedly called an Ooh
La La -- rye, Averna, honey, Fernet.

I think it tastes reminiscient of a hot mulled apple cider, but cold.
8 thinks it's more like a hot toddy, but cold.  Either way, it's deliciously
sour and spicy, with just enough sweet to balance the punch.  Like a finely
tuned nutty whiskey sour.
