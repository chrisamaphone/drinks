Pumpkin King (from Jamie Boudreau: http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/669/raising_the_bar_pumpkin_king/)

1 1/2 oz blended scotch
1/2 oz lime
1/2 oz pumpkin beer liqueur (see below)
dash of Angostura (or other aromatic) bitters

Serve in a collins glass over ice.  Top with ginger beer.  Garnish: lime wheel.

Tasty and well-balanced.  But if using a strong ginger beer (e.g., Goya),
don't overdo it!  Just a splash is enough to marry the other ingredients and
spices together nicely.

To make the pumpkin beer liqueur, combine 1 cup Southern Tier Pumking with
2 cups sugar and some extra pumpkin spices (cinnamon stick, some cloves, a
bit of allspice) in a pot over heat, stirring frequently to dissipate excess
carbonation and incorporate the spices.  After about 5 minutes on heat, as it
starts to expand rapidly, remove it from the heat and skim off and discard the
sticky foam.  Strain into a bottle and mix 4:1 with a nice cognac to preserve,
fortify, and balance.  Delicious!

Considered calling this the Jack Skellington to feature it at Truly Irate
Science Party Halloween 2012, but that's too easily confused with the
Jack-o-Lantern.

10-31-2012: Take 2, with some slightly altered ratios:

2 oz blended scotch
3/4 oz lime
3/4 oz pumpkin beer liqueur
dash of Angostura bitters

Top *lightly* with just a *splash* of ginger beer.

This works well, too -- the scotch still comes through (at least if it's the
Black Grouse), but you get some of the other flavors as well.  This ratio was
devised to bring out the pumpkin a bit more and fill the glass a bit higher
before topping with ginger beer.  It's still *really* important to have a light
hand when pouring the ginger beer, or it will overpower the drink.

Tried sprinkling a dash of cinnamon on top, and that was nice.  Ben says to try
cardamom instead, to pair with the lime.
