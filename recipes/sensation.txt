Sensation

1.5 gin
.5 lime juice?
.25 maraschino liqueur
3 mint sprigs

Garnish with a mint sprig.

Completely delicious and refreshing summer drink.  Works nicely with Hendrick's,
making for a very vegetal drink -- the mint complements the Hendrick's like a
nice cool cucumber.  Also very tasty -- and perhaps more balanced -- with a
solid mixing gin like Bluecoat.
