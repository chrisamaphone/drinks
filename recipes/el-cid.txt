El Cid (from Estadio on 14th St NW in DC)

1-1/2 oz dry oloroso sherry
3/4 oz honey simple (i assume this means honey/water 1:1)
1/2 oz lime juice
1/2 oz Campari

Extremely well-balanced!  Nutty, refreshing, not too sweet, not too dry...
I had to ask for the recipe on this one, because it was such a standout.
Sherry and Campari!  Two of my favorite things, together at last.  Honey
is probably important as a binder...
