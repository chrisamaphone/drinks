Melon (needs a name)

1-1/2 gin (Old Tom works well)
1 oz watermelon juice (or maybe a splash more)
1/2 oz Chartreuse
dash rhubarb bitters

The Chartreuse complements the watermelen just as well as basil, which is to
say *awesomely*.  Rhubarb bitters finishes it off and ties it together.  I
think it could benefit from some more sour notes -- maybe a bit of lemon?
I dunno, though, watermelon and lemon... maybe watermelon and lime?  (Actually,
after the evening was over when we made this drink, i mixed a splash of lemon
juice in with the remaining watermelon, and it was fantastic, so maybe this is
a sensible idea..)

To be sure, though, it was a really nice cocktail without the sour notes anyway.
Simple to make, yet full of flavor and wonder.

(Had a melon cocktail at Bikefest party that involved compressed melon cubes
soaked in June, a floral liqueur.  Maybe toss in some orange flower water?  Or
some creme de violette, because that's so sorely underrepresented in cocktails
i know how to make.. wonder what kind of color we'd wind up with)
