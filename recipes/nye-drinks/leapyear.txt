Leap Year (from Cocktail)

2 gin
.5 sweet vermouth
.5 Cointreau (Cocktail calls for Grand Marnier, but suggests subbing Cointreau)
.25 lemon juice

Garnish with a twist of lemon (or orange).

Twist of lemon was key -- the essential oils mellowed it out nicely, otherwise
a rather high alcohol flavor drink.

In retrospect, not far off from a gin martini, but with sweet vermouth rather
than dry.
