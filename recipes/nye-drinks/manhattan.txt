Manhattan (from Cocktail)

2 rye
.5 sweet vermouth
1 to 2 dashes Angostura bitters ("optional", but not really)

Garnish with a maraschino cherry.

To make it "perfect", use half dry vermouth and half sweet vermouth,
and garnish with a twist.  To make it "imperfect", use half dry vermouth
and half sweet vermouth, but garnish with a maraschino cherry anyway.

To make a Wall Street (wallstreet.txt) use half dry vermouth and half
Black Walnut Pi.

Variations:
    "A dash of a cordial like Cointreau, Byrrh, or Kummel will make a
    Manhattan more complex in taste."

    "An Uptown Manhattan is a perfect Manhattan with a splash of lemon
    juice.  The Sidney is a dry Manhattan [wjl: dry vermouth instead of
    sweet] with a dash of orange bitters and a splash of Chartreuse."
