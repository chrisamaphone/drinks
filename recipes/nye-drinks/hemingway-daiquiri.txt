Hemingway Daiquiri (from Cocktail)

1.5 light rum
.25 maraschino liqueur
.75 lime juice
.25 grapefruit juice

Garnish with a lime wheel.

I haven't tried this one yet, but it sounds pretty awesome!  No sugar in this
one -- any sweetness comes from the liqueur or the juices.  Cocktail suggests
flash blending, since ice cold and well-mixed are two key properties of the
Hemingway Daiquiri.

02-02-2011: Tried it after smuggling some maraschino liqueur back from Texas.
Not as cloying as a regular daiquiri.  The grapefruit doesn't come through
super strong, though.
