        Saintly Maiden's Prayer
        (Brian) (Im)perfect Manhattan (Im- because he used the wrong garnish)

    The Day After -- some simpler classics

    Made:
        Martini (i think it'd be better without throwing out the vermouth)
        Pink Gin (extraordinarily interesting for being basically just gin and
                  bitters!  squeeze of lime makes a big difference, i guess..)
        Raspberry Lemondrop
        Stone Sour (Whiskey Sour with a splash of orange juice)
