Milk Punch (from Cocktail)

3 oz whiskey (Cocktail calls for bourbon, but we used Forty Creek Canadian)
3 oz milk
.5 tsp vanilla (Cocktail calls for dark rum, but we didn't have any)
1 tbsp simple syrup

Dust with nutmeg -- fresh ground is best!

Shake with ice, strain into a tumbler, dust with nutmeg.  Tastes like eggnog!
Or a bourbon milkshake.  A perfect nightcap.  (Supposedly good hot, too.)

01-10-2011: Notes on making it warm: probably better to combine all ingredients
and heat rather than combining everything but the whiskey over heat and then
combining with the whiskey at the end.  I tried the latter, and it caused the
milk to curdle.

Also, to make with 100 proof bourbon, use 2.5 oz bourbon and .5 oz water --
that makes a 1.25 oz / 3 oz =~ 41.66% =~ 84 proof whiskey.  But i should
probably buy something cheaper than Knob Creek to put in this thing...

01-15?-2011: doesn't help to combine them all together -- still curdles, and
even vigorous stirring results in some dregs at the bottom.  At least one
source online says you're supposed to filter the curds out with a cheesecloth.
I hope for a more chemistry-based solution.
