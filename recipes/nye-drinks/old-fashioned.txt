Old Fashioned (from Cocktail)

2 whiskey
2 dashes Angostura bitters
1 teaspoon sugar
Splash of soda

The preparation is a bit tricky.  In a chilled Old Fashioned glass, muddle the
sugar, bitters, an orange wheel, and (optionally, imho) a maraschino cherry
until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the whiskey and ice, and stir.  Optionally
garnish with a lemon twist (or alternatively, with the cherry whose life you
spared!)

Consider not muddling the cherry -- it just makes a bloody mess and doesn't add
much flavor-wise.  Muddling the orange wheel is *essential*, though!  Some
recipes even call for muddling a lemon wedge, but that's going a bit too far --
it's a drink, not a fruit salad :)

Another option is to add a dash of an orange liqueur such as curacao or
Cointreau.
