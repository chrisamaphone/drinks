Stone Sour (from Cocktail)

2 whiskey
2 lemon juice
.5 simple syrup
Splash of orange juice

Serve over ice, after shaking.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry and an
orange wheel.

Just a whiskey sour with a splash of fresh orange juice.  Makes for a sweeter
and more indulgent cocktail.  I like this one as a night cap -- warming and
soothing.
