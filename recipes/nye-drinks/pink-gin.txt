Pink Gin (from Cocktail)

3 gin
2 dashes bitters

Garnish with a (generous) lime squeeze.

Don't skimp on the lime, lest you create a drink that's too much just like
a cup of gin!  Sufficient lime juice combines with the tiny amount of bitters
to create a spicy, herbal tartness that melds perfectly with a quality gin.
Rather complex for such a simple composition!  Definitely one to have somewhat
sparingly, though :)
