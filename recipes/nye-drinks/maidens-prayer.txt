Maiden's Prayer (from Cocktail)

1 Gin
1 Rum
1 Cointreau
1 Lemon juice

Garnish with a lemon twist or a flower blossom.

0.75 ounces was the recommended part size, but 1 ounce would probably work as
well.  Tastes like delicious lemonade!  Definitely a crowd pleaser, but a bit
more complex than most crowd pleasers, having four ingredients.

To make it "Saintly" -- a bit sweeter and more awesome -- add 0.5 St. Germain.

05-08-2012: Works well with half lemon half lime (left over from cinco de mayo
margaritas).  I realized tonight that this is basically a Sidecar with gin/rum
as the base instead of brandy.  I approve!  Also, i garnished it with a lime
wheel, which may have helped bring out the Sidecar association.  Called it a
Maiden's Hope, in my mind -- slightly sharper than a prayer.
