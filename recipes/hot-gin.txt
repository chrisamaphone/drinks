Hot Gin

1-1/2 oz gin
1 sugar cube (1/2 tsp)
3-4 oz hot water
lemon twist
optional: dash orange bitters, or Peychaud's, for a more herbal drink.

To try: use Earl Grey tea instead of hot water.  Bergamot + botanicals!

01-06-2013: Cold day today -- furnace was out for a while -- so i tried the
Earl Grey thing, but used honey instead of sugar.  Verdict: 8 oz Earl Grey
is probably a bit much, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The honey -- only
a barspoon -- was actually a bit overpowering, too, i think.  Try a sugar
cube next time?
