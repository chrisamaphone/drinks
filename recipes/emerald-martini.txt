Emerald Martini

1.5 gin
.5 dry vermouth
dash (.125) Green Chartreuse

Garnish: lemon twist.

Not enough Green Chartreuse, imho -- i've never been a big fan of the dash.
Also, dry vermouth is kind of gross, even Noilly Prat, in the same way as
white wine.  Maybe i should have some by itself one of these days just to
give it a chance.. with a thin slice of lemon, just before dinner.. l'heure
de l'ap√©ro.
