Apple Pie (from Cocktail -- but not one of the "classics")

1.5 dark rum
1 sweet vermouth
.5 lemon juice
.125 grenadine

Garnish with a lemon wheel.

Taste complexity: 4
Mixing difficulty: 3

Substituting dark rum with a white rum and vanilla mixture resulted in
something far too vanilla-heavy -- the proportions were too far off, and
the vanilla flavor didn't really add enough of what dark rum is supposed
to be.  In the future, in the absence of dark rum, i might just use white
rum and a couple drops of vanilla, or white rum and a dash of molasses.
But just getting some dark rum is probably preferrable, since it's a tasty
and versatile ingredient in its own right...
