Bonita Applebum

1.5 applejack
.75 Fernet-Branca
.75 Drambuie

Thought this would be *way* too Fernet-y, but it's actually pretty
well-balanced -- if anything, a little on the sweet side!  I guess
the Drambuie is pretty assertive as well, huh.  I shook it instead
of stirring it, because i thought the foam would do it well.  Didn't
garnish, either.. not sure what it would want!

This one came from @FernetBranca on Twitter, originally by Emma
Hollander at Trina's Starlite Lounge in Somerville, MA.
