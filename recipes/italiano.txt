Italiano -- an aperitif i made up, inspired by an Americano Maison

1-1/2 oz Cocchi di Torino sweet vermouth
1-1/2 oz Gran Classico bitter

Stir, pour over ice in a short glass, top with soda, garnish with an orange peel.

Subs the sweeter Gran Classico for the bitter Campari, but tempers it with the
bitterer-than-usual Cocchi di Torino.  The soda and garnish are key to bringing
out all the flavors.  I really liked this one.

To also try: with Punt e Mes!
