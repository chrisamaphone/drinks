Angostura Fizz (from Bitters)

1 oz Angostura
1 oz lime
1/4 oz simple
1/4 oz grenadine
1/2 oz cream
1 egg white

Dry shake, shake with ice, strain into a chilled coupe.  Top with seltzer.

Made 05-26-2013 for 8's birthday party.  Actually, the recipe above made two
drinks, with sufficient shaking -- possibly it could make just one if you
measured a quantity of egg white, and/or if you used a largish coupe.

Forgot to write this one down in the excitement of the party, but iirc, it was
delicious as all hell (i had the spare).  Tasted like Christmas balanced.
Refreshing and soothing to the stomach.  Wonderful mouthfeel, and all around a
very drinkable bitters-heavy cocktail.
