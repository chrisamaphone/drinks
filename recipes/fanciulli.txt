(a good write-up in the WSJ: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123092858411149807.html)

1-1/2 oz whiskey
3/4 oz sweet vermouth
3/4 oz Fernet-Branca (WSJ article says 1/4, though)

Fanciulli -- Salieri to Sousa's Mozart, a fallen and forgotten leader of the
United States Marine Corps Band.  His bitterness immortalized herein.

02-20-2013, on a Fernet kick:

The Straight Up recommends a heavy whiskey, like Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond
Rye or Knob Creek.  I have an old bottle of Knob Creek bourbon sitting around,
so i tried that.  For sweet vermouth, the old standby Cinzano.  What a curious
cocktail!  The whiskey really does play balancer to the Fernet -- i dunno if
it's the particular combination of ingredients or the fact that i haven't
tasted Knob Creek in a long time, but this drink tastes like some sort of
mentholated caramel!  This feels more balanced than the Hanky Panky i had the
other day.  I wonder if that one could be tweaked, or perhaps improved with a
more assertive sweet vermouth.  I don't know if i'd dial this one back to 1/4
oz of the Fernet, as the WSJ article recommends, but maybe it's worth a shot.
I just don't think the Fernet is too potent here -- it really *is* nicely
balanced by the whiskey, at least the Knob Creek.

It's like a Fernet Boulevardier!  Everyone describes it like a Manhattan, but
both the Boulevardier and this are so sufficiently different from a Manhattan
that i'd say they live in a class all by themselves -- the herbal component
really makes a serious difference.

05-08-2014: Made it at Brian's with 90 proof Elmer T. Lee -- not as nicely
balanced, i didn't think, but it was still tasty.  Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 oz of
the Fernet would've worked better with this milder sippin' whiskey.
