Hanky Panky

1-1/2 oz gin
1-1/2 oz sweet ("Italian") vermouth
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca ("2 dashes")

Garnish: orange peel.

Found this one online around Valentine's Day.  Apparently invented somewhat
recently?  Originally called for cognac instead of gin.  Made today 02-15-2013
for Matt and Amy, two of Lea's guests at her "my new coworkers!" party.

I found it a bit heavy on the sweet vermouth side, and didn't catch much change
from the Fernet-Branca, but i guess it did play a role.  Ironically, Matt, who
says he's not usually into vermouth, liked this one.  I challenged him that
maybe he'd never had good vermouth, but he insisted he buys good stuff, and
when i asked if he refrigerated it, he said yes.  So go figure.  Maybe he gets
Martini and Rossi?  (I used Cinzano, per house standards.)

I do really like the combination of orange oils, herbs, and mint.  (See the
Minty Nail... recently re-envisioned!  Well, re-garnished, i guess... well,
garnished at all.. for the first time..)

Update, 03-12-2013: made this with a 1-1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ratio, and it was very
different, but much more like the drink i wanted it to be :)
