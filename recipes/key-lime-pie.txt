Key Lime Pie (invention, 07-19-2014)

[1 oz light rum]
1 oz orange juice
1 oz lime juice
1/2 oz orgeat (#2, Pacific brand)
[1/2 oz dark rum floated on top]

Garnish: lime wheel

Made for Lea 07-19-2014, and Lyndsey Moulds (Lea's guest and my houseguest for
the weekend) identified the unique mixture of vanilla cake batter-ness (from the
Pacific almond milk) and sharp lime tartness (from the limes) as Key Lime Pie.

07-20-2014: Made for Lyndsey the following night, but plus 1 oz of light rum,
and then i tried serving it in a highball glass over ice, but it was too short,
so i floated half an oz of dark rum on top, which helped.  (Before, i'd poured
it into a lowball glass with the ice.)
