Bijou

1 gin
1 sweet vermouth
1 green chartreuse

Garnish: cherry.  Or a Meyer lemon twist.  Or just a lemon twist :P
(Though i should get to finding some cherries that aren't terrible...)
(Amarena?  Marasca?)

We used Citadelle and Cinzano, of course -- herbal and dry.  Still, quite a
sweet drink with these proportions!  Kind of like a Ricola cough drop: herbal,
sweet, and cool.  Probably worth trying the "popular variation":

1-1/2 gin
1/2 sweet vermouth
1/2 green chartreuse

or the Embury version:

1-1/2 gin
3/4 sweet vermouth
1/2 green chartreuse

i.e., a "sweet martini" with "3-4 dashes of chartreuse".

Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012, using the "popular
variation".  Worked well, i think, and was popular among a certain crowd,
but it wasn't a top seller.  I kept forgetting to make it with an herbal
gin, though.

Idea: try this with Dolin Blanc instead of sweet vermouth -- then the green
would come through!

Update, 04-24-2012: Tried it.  Much nicer color, indeed, but the flavor was
just not as good as with sweet vermouth.  I think sweet vermouth is actually
surprisingly complex.. it adds an awful lot to a drink.

Update, 04-10-2013: Rachel Maddow likes this one, and a dash of orange bitters
is suggested (http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/03/time-for-a-drink-bijou-cocktail-recipe.html).

Update 01-02-2013: Barrel-aged a batch of the 3:1:1 recipe, plus orange bitters.
Garnished with my house-made brandied cherries.  Went over pretty well -- David
especially thought it was fantastic.  I think they could use a bit longer in the
barrel, myself; two weeks just barely lent a note of oak, and the chartreuse
still has an edge to round out.  (It's the 4th aging in that barrel, too.)
