Straight Law [from Savoy]

1 oz dry sherry [i used oloroso]
1/2 oz dry gin [i used Boodles for its savory qualities]

Kind of a reverse martini.  I made it for the first time at home in Burton
over Thanksgiving break, while watching Newsroom, Friday, 11-29-2013.  The
Savoy Cocktail Book just lists 1/3 dry gin, 2/3 dry sherry, and i didn't
need a big drink, so i just made a tiny one in a tiny brandy snifter glass.
(I was also limited by measuring device availability -- i just used a tbsp.)
It's sort of like a mellowed out/kicked up sherry -- the flavor is subtler,
and depending on the botanicals in the gin, they can meld into a really nice,
smooth experience.
