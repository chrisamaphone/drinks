Amaro Digestivo
(from the Straight Up, http://drinkstraightup.com/2012/12/20/amaro-digestivo/)

Equal parts (i did 1/2 oz):

Averna
Campari
Cynar
Fernet-Branca
Strega

Pour in glass.  Drink.

No muss, no fuss -- no stirring, no shaking, no ice, no garnish.  (I guess you
could try to be fancy and layer it, but i'm not sure these ingredients have
enough difference in specific gravity to float on one another.. will have to
experiment some time..)

Surprisingly balanced for its haphazardness -- the Fernet and the Strega, in
particular, seem to balance one another, so it's not too strong but not too
sweet.  Both Fernet and Strega contain saffron as a chief ingredient (in fact,
Fernet supposedly uses some significant fraction of all the saffron that's
produced in the world, iirc), and they combine nicely for that reason.
