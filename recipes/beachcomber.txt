Beachcomber (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz light rum
3/4 oz lime juice
1/2 oz Cointreau
1/4 oz (2 dashes?) maraschino liqueur
(optional: tiiiiny dash almond extract -- like < 1/4 tsp)

Flash blend with ice.  Serve unstrained in a wine glass.
Garnish: lime squeeze, sprig of mint, tiny umbrella (optional)

Nice refreshing tiki drink, for a movie about a dystopian city where the sun
never comes out!  Inspired by Shell Beach unattainability in Dark City, for
Cinelawn Salon viewing 2013-07-12.

The flash blending didn't work as well as i wanted it to -- too much of the
ice didn't break up in my blender.  Maybe try more pulsing?  Less pulsing?
