St. Germain Gin and Tonic (from http://www.stgermain.fr)

1.5 gin
1 St. Germain
3 tonic water
squeeze of lime, toss it in for garnish

Too tonic-y for my tastes, but Katie liked it.  Should experiment with
St. Germain in my "perfect gin and tonic".

For better presentation, would probably just add a bit of lime juice and
garnish with a twist -- that should still get the essential oils that Katie
likes.

Add a dash of bitters to spice things up a bit.  This helps with the tonic-y
flavor.
