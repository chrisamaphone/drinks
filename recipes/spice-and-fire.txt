Song of Spice and Fire

1-1/2 oz bourbon
3/4 oz Dolin blanc
1/4 oz Domaine de Canton
1 dash Angostura

Garnish: flamed lemon peel.

Invented 04-16-2013 for Dom, who'd just spent all day on planes, was eating a
plate of seitan stir fry, and wanted something "strong and sweet... strong and
sweet".  I figured the ginger liqueur would complement the stir fry well, and
from there i followed Jamie Boudreau's golden ratio formula.  I opted for Dolin
blanc (a similar blanc aperitif wine would work, i imagine, e.g., Lillet) so
the drink would be sweet but not overpowered, like it might with sweet vermouth.
The Angostura was to play up the spice.

Dom said it tasted like beer, and i agreed on mouthfeel -- the ginger liqueur
gave it a burn not unlike carbonation.  That selfsame burn inspired my name for
it.  (Started calling it the "Fire and Ice", but i really like the punny name
instead, and it totally did have fire!  And spice!)
