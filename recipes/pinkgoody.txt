Pink Goody

1 gin
1 rum
.75 lime
.25 maraschino liqueur

A rare 1:3:8 combo, with two bases!  We tried it with Martin Miller's the first
time, to try to make something stand up to the lime.  Not a sweet drink, but a
well-balanced one -- the maraschino is subdued somewhat by its small portion.
Wonder if a stronger gin would work -- e.g., Tub, or Tanq 10?
