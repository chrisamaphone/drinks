A variety of fizz experiments i've tried, and their outcomes.
Standard preparation rules apply (dry shake with egg, top with seltzer, etc.)


Golden Fizz: 2 gin, 1 lemon, 1/2 simple, 1 egg yolk.  Garnish: lemon twist.
  - very rich, almost like a Ramos Gin Fizz.  Quite impressed!  One of my faves.

Silver Fizz: 2 gin, 1 lemon, 1/2 simple, 1 egg white.  Garnish: lemon twist.
  - beautifully foamy texture, but not much flavor from the egg white.

Royal Fizz: 2 gin, 1 lemon, 1/2 simple, 1 egg.  Garnish: lemon twist.
  - oddly, loses the best properties of silver and golden alone.

Maraschino Golden Fizz: 2 gin, 1 lemon, 1/2 maraschino, 1 egg yolk.  G: lem t.
  - too dry -- the seltzer, gin, lemon, and natural tartness of the maraschino
    dominate.  Not fun enough to be a proper fizz.  1/4 oz creme de violette
    did help a bit.

Rum Falernum Fizz: 2 rum, 1 lime, 1/2 falernum.  Garnish: lime wheel.
  - still pretty dry.  Nothing sweetens like rich simple.. ~1/4 oz more
    falernum helped balance it a bit, but the cloves really don't come
    through as much as i'd like.
  - Idea: More falernum?  Maybe an egg yolk, for noggy richness?
  - Idea: Top with fizzy ginger ale, instead!

Golden Rum Falernum Fizz: 1-1/2 rum, 3/4 lime, 1/2 falernum, 1 egg yolk.  G: lt.
  - better than above, but too little stuff.  Maybe try 2-1-3/4 (i.e, 1.5-2-4)?
    the cloves of the falernum really *do* go well with the yolk.
  - also tried it with 1/2 oz cream; almost indistinguishable -- adds little.

Daiquiri Fizz: 2 rum, 1 lime, 1/2 simple[, 1 egg yolk].  Garnish: lime wheel.
  - *almost* as good as the gin fizz, heh.  Theory: lime requires bitters
    (cf. Pegu, Ninth Ward, First Word, ...)


Q: which variations benefit most from the addition of egg yolk?
Q: which variations benefit most from the addition of egg white?
Q: are there any that actually benefit more from an entire egg?

Q: what are some good ratio guidelines?
A: 1-2-4 works well if the 1 is rich simple.  Perhaps closer to 1-2-3 would
   help other sweeteners work, or the Aviation's classic 2-3-6 (i.e., 1.3-2-4).

Q: what bitterses would work well in a fizz?
A: ??? _Bitters_ talks of an Angostura Fizz!  A Lytton Fizz has black strap
   rum, falernum, and Angostura (though a strange 2-1-2 ratio.. the lime is
   relegated to the role of accent).  (Actually, adashofbitters.com's post
   realized there had to be a typo -- 1/2 --> 1-1/2 -- making the actual
   ratio 2-1-6..???)
