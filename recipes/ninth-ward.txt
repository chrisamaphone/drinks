Ninth Ward

1-1/2 (Bulleit) bourbon
3/4 lime
3/4 falernum
1/2 St. Germain
dash or two Peychaud's bitters

garnish: orange wheel

Named for one of New Orleans's districts, this variation on the Ward Eight
incorporates a number of tropical/Carribean ingredients in place of the usual
lemon/orange/grenadine combo.  In place of the sweetener is falernum, a sugary
rum infusion with lots of clove and lime flavors; in place of the citrus is
lime.  St. Germain smoothes the sharp sweetness of the falernum.  Peychaud's
pulls it all together, accentuating the spicey notes in the falernum and making
the drink fully balanced.

Complexity 4.  Like a Pegu.  Unlike almost any other bourbon drink!  Falernum
calls for more experimentation.

K2 brought this back from California via Krieger.  He picked it up at some
speakeasy there.

01-21-2012: Take care not to overdo the bitters; they will take over if they can.

Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Quite popular at
times!  Tom's friends Neal Martin, Martin Hock, and Pete something all loved
it, thought it was quite complex -- i of course am inclined to agree!
