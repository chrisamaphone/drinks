Amaroni

1 gin
1 sweet vermouth
1 Averna Amaro

Like a Negroni but with Amaro!  Has digestif properties despite being made of
aperitif ingredients.  Garnish with an almond?  "Warming." -Kempy

Orange peel works, too.  Perhaps better?


update 01-20-2012: Drop everything to 3/4 oz and add 1/2 oz Bittermen's Hiver
Amere for a warm, wintery, orangey delight!  Also kind of works to just drop
the sweet vermouth, which creates a particularly spicey, orangey, strong amaro.
Kat prefers it with the sweet vermouth though.


Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Car loved it!
Still one of Kat's favorites.

    Me: <something about drinking all the gin at the party>
    Kat: Well, i won't be helping..
    Me: *quizzical look* You're not drinking?
        ... Or you *might* have an Amaroni..
    Kat: But that doesn't have gin in it, right?
    Me: ... Uh... yeah it does :)
    Kat: Really?  Well an Aviation doesn't have gin, right?
    Me: ... Uh... yeah it does :)
