Fancy-Free

2 bourbon
.5 maraschino liqueur
dash Angostura bitters
dash orange bitters

First drink i liked with orange bitters!  Smells like beer, weirdly.  I think
the Angostura goes a long way towards making the orange bitters what i wanted
it to be in the first place.  Interesting combination of flavors -- sweet, but
not too sweet, and not extremely maraschino-sweet -- a lot of bourbon sweet-
ness comes through.

Ben was a huge fan.  One of his new favorites.  I used our newly-acquired
vintage-style cocktail glasses, like the small one on the cover of Embury.
