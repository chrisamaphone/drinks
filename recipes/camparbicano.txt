Made this one for Matt Kehrt at Carnival 2012 when he complained that all the
drinks we'd made him before were too sweet.

Actually, made it first for myself 5 days previous, and found it to be
*extremely* refreshing!


Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Sort of.
Nobody ordered it.  But i made the Camparbicano off-menu for Matt Kehrt.
