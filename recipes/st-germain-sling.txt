St. Germain Sling
(http://www.nola.com/cocktails/index.ssf/2010/04/st-germain_sling.html)

2 oz gin (Hendrick's works best)
3/4 oz St. Germain
1/2 oz Cherry Heering
1/2 oz lemon juice
2 dashes Angostura bitters
2 dashes orange bitters
soda

Serve over ice in a Collins glass, topped with soda.

A tall, icy drink for a hot summer day, but one with more complexity than the
usual fizz or Collins.  Very refreshing, but not sickly.  I was skeptical due
to the reversal of the usual sweet-sour in an Embury-style sour-type cocktail,
with the sour being about half the sweet.  I went ahead and tried it though,
and came to understand that citrus can serve as an accent and not a primary
modifier.  Worth remembering in the future!
