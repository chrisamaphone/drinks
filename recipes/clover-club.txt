Clover Club (from Cocktail)

2 oz gin
1 oz lemon
1/4 oz grenadine
2 tsp egg white

Garnish: lemon wheel.

First made by me Sunday, 10-14-2012, while i was all alone with no one to drink
with.  (8 just left and Chris was in Toronto.)

Normally i stand behind Cocktail pretty strongly, but on this drink, i think
they got a bunch of things wrong.

    (1) too much lemon,
    (2) too little grenadine,
    (3) wtf, 2 tsp egg white?

Now (1) and (2) are arguably the same problem, since basically, the problem
was that the drink was unbalanced.  It could be that our homemade grenadine
does not have as strong a flavor as Cocktail expects it to, also.  I have two
theories on how to fix it: halve the lemon, or double the grenadine.  I actually
suspect that both will be acceptable, but make for a nice pair of variations:
sweeter vs. drier.  I realized while thinking this problem over -- clued in by
the extremely low rated taste complexity (1/5, i think) -- that this drink is
basically just a gin sour with grenadine as the sweetener and the optional egg
white component permitted of any sour.  Doubling the grenadine would yield my
usual 1:2:4 sour, while halving the lemon would yield the classic Embury 1:2:8.
I'd like to try both.

As for (3), i dunno.. maybe it's just really hard to parcel out teaspoons of
egg white and i didn't get the right parts, but wow, that egg white added like
*nothing* to this drink.  I'm thinkin' stick with whole egg whites, and make
two at a time if you want to lower the ratio.  Or pick and choose egg sizes,
but that gets to be pretty annoying, i'll bet.

8 and Lizzie had made this when we had our grenadine cocktail party last
Wednesday.  Theirs came out nice and foamy.  Not sure what they did differently.
