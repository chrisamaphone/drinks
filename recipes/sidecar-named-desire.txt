Sidecar Named Desire (from Monterey Bay Fish Grotto)

1-1/2 brandy
3/4 lemon
3/4 Cointreau
2-3 strawberries
dollop of egg white

Muddle strawberries, add alcohol, add egg white, dry shake, ice, shake, strain.

Garnish: a strawberry on the rim.

I actually made a double portion using a whole egg white, and it came out to be
three drinks worth.  Crazy, but delicious.
