Kempy Finn (a variation on the Nicky Finn, based on drinks requested by Kempy)

1 cognac
1 lemon juice
.5 Benedictine
.5 Domaine de Canton
.125 Pernod (a dash)

Kempy requested a drink that contained all of Domaine de Canton, Benedictine,
and Pernod, and the obvious choice to riff on was the Nicky Finn.  So i took
the basic recipe and replaced the 1 ounce of sweet (Cointreau) with half
Benedictine and half Canton.  Perfect!  Delicious.
