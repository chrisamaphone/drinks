take 1, 06-26-2012:
2 oz Irish whiskey
1/2 oz Fernet-Branca

Stir.  Garnish with a lemon twist.  Serve over ice in a rocks glass.

The idea here is to turn the /consigliere/ from the Godfather into a drink.
He's German-Irish, but clearly part of an Italian family.  Actually, i was
inspired by the Rusty Nail (2 oz Scotch, 1/2 oz Drambuie), but wanted to
use Fernet.  I'd already done the "Minty Nail" (1-1 Drambuie and Fernet,
with the Fernet kind of taking the place of the base, and the Drambuie
serving to balance), but i wanted something stronger and harsher (i'm
currently recovering from a cold).  I thought that Irish whiskey might
do better against the Fernet than Scotch, so i started thinking of
Italian/Irish things to name it after, and Tom Hagen came to mind.

It's a little rough, i'll be honest.  Maybe it needs some "German" --
Jagermeister?


01-14-2013: Finally got around to trying this with the Jager.  Modified the
recipe to a more typical proportion, following the rousing success of the
Kate's Apero the other night:

1-1/2 oz Irish whiskey (i used Tullamore Dew 12 year)
3/4 oz Jagermeister
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca

Is this one of them Italian digestivos?  It's German-Irish.
Actually pretty well-balanced in these proportions.  Not bad!
Didn't do a lemon twist, though, partly because i didn't feel
like cutting up a lemon, and partly because i'm not sure it's
actually the right garnish.  What would be?

Update, via Twitter: Sean Enright (of erstwhile Embury fame)
suggests, "horse's head!  Boom!  Cocktology!" :)
