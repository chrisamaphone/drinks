Christmas in July

1-1/2 Bittermen's Hiver Am√®re
Soda
Angostura float (maybe ~1/4 oz)

Serve in a tall fizz glass filled with ice.  I guess it's more of a Collins
than a fizz, but there's not much to it, so you don't want to put it in a
larger Collins glass.

Anyway, it's cool -- you get all these wintery spice flavors, but in an
ice-cold fizzy drink full of refreshing deliciousness!  Invented 07-17-2012
because i didn't want to drink straight soda.
