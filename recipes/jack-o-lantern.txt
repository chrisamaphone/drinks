Jack-o-Lantern
p
(take 1)
2 oz applejack
1 oz lime juice
1/2 oz maple syrup
2 dashes black walnut bitters

Garnish: flamed orange peel.

Really sour.  Wants to be more mapley, more fall-appley, less sour-appley.
To try: 1/2 oz *lemon* juice instead.  See if the other flavors take center
stage more.

The orange peel does play nicely with the maple!

1/2 oz lemon
1/2 oz maple syrup
2 dashes black walnut bitters

Better, but now too sweet.  Some non-scientific experimentation suggests that
3/4 oz lemon juice might be perfect -- the maple and black walnut get to play
off of each other then, and it's a wonderful fall drink.
