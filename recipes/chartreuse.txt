Chartreuse

1.5 bourbon
.75 Green Chartreuse
.5 dry vermouth

Garnish with an orange squeeze.

Smooth and delicious!  Stir for maximum clarity and it makes for a very pretty
drink, though i'm not quite sure how to make orange squeezes just yet.  Even
non-whiskey-lovers like this, e.g. Kat!  It's a perfect example of a drink
where all the ingredients combine to form something unlike any of them -- the
Chartreuse definitely plays a major role, but you can tell it's not the only
player, and the dry vermouth, not my most favored of ingredients, makes only
a brief cameo to accentuate the Chartreuse's herbs so they aren't overpowered
by the high alcohol bite.

07-30-2011: Not substantially different with Noilly Prat, a significantly drier
dry vermouth with an almost champagne brightness in the mouth.
