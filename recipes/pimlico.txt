Chris's birthday party-- william requested a drink and chris and william
made this up together. the request was to use the averna, plus we had some
mint around.

so we made kind of a variant on a mint julep with the averna playing the
role of the sweet.

1.5oz bourbon
1oz   averna
1tsp  cointreau
several sprigs of mint

muddle a few torn up mint leaves in the bottom of the mixing tin, with the
averna. add the bourbon and cointreau. stir with ice.

pour over crushed ice in a julep glass. garnish with an orange wedge and
big mint sprig.

"the pimloco." because horse race terms, i guess.
