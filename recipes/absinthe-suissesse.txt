Absinthe Suissesse (my own recipe)

1-1/2 oz absinthe
1/2 oz orgeat
1 oz heavy cream
1 egg white

Dry shake, shake over ice, and serve over crushed ice in a rocks glass.

This is a classic New Orleans drink, but there are a few variations out there.
Many call for 1/2 oz of cr√®me de menthe, but i refuse to use that until i can
get my hands on a decent one.  Some call for more heavy cream, like up to 2 oz
(e.g. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Absinthe-Suissesse-350803).
I cobbled this together from a few sources and gave it a shot.

Rather tasty!  Strong fennel notes -- i used Herbsaint, which might be a more
herbal absinthe substitute, i forget -- but it almost reminded me of a Chinese
dish, or maybe just Chinese five-spice powder.

More or less how i remembered it from New Orleans -- creamy, herbal, refreshing,
and decadent, all at once.  The almond from the orgeat takes a back seat, as
usual.  I was still using the Engine-2-based orgeat, though; maybe the Pacific
one will fare better.
