1-1/2 oz rye
3/4 oz applejack
3/4 oz Green Chartreuse

One of seriouseats.com's 5 essential rye cocktails.  Herbal and strong,
a good cold-curing fall drink.  Tom 7 liked it.  (10-29-2012?)

10-04-2014: Back for the Fall!  I like to garnish it with a brandied cherry
these days.  This drink is 3 ounces of > 80 proof booze.  Maybe i should make
a 2 oz version.. I only realized its extreme proof when explaining it -- start
with a strong rye base, then cut it with... uh.. strong apple brandy.. but then
to bring it down to a reasonable level, add some, uh, 120 proof liqueur??  Okay!
