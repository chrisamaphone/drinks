Mulholland Railroad (non-alcoholic)

1 oz grapefruit juice
1/2 oz lime juice
1/2 oz grenadine

Serve up, topped with a splash of soda.  Garnish with a lime wheel.

Deliciously tart.  Invented for Cinema Salon 2014-02-15, when we watched
Mulholland Drive.  Someone suggested the name Mulholland Iced Tea, then
David modified it to Mulholland Railroad, after Long Island Railroad.

I was happy with how balanced this came out to be.  I think my grenadine
is naturally somewhat tart in its sweetening power..
