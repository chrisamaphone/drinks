Homemade Grenadine (modified from Jeffrey Morgenthaler's recipe [1])

8 oz (1 cup) pomegranate juice
8 oz (1 cup) sugar
2 oz pomegranate molasses
1-2 tsp orange blossom water

You can make pomegranate juice from fresh pomegranates using a juicer (gasp!),
or alternatively, there's always POM.  The 2 oz pomegranate molasses is where
i differ from Morgenthaler -- his recipe only calls for 1 oz (well, actually,
2 oz, but it's a doubled recipe compared to mine), but i think it needs that
extra tartness and sugar concentration.  Imbibe Magazine agrees [2].

Easiest way to mix it all up: heat the pomegranate juice gently -- about 2
minutes in the microwave, long enough to warm but not cook -- and then put
everything in a jar and shake like the dickens.

If the orange blossom water is the kind in 45% alcohol, that'll help preserve
it.  I suspect 2 tsp might be perfect.  I just made a batch (12-16-2014) with
3 tsp, and it's too much.  Might try to make half a batch and fix it up... or
just see how it is after cooling and combining.

12-17-2014: Discovered some improved methods.  First, pomegranate seeds can
easily be removed from the husk via the "spank" method [3].  Then, pomegranate
seeds can eminently be transformed into pomegranate juice by blending and
straining [4, 5] -- i didn't even add any extra water.  Also, in the batch i
made today, i didn't bother heating the juice at all (the "cold process method"
[6]), and it seems to have worked well enough, possibly even with improved
flavor by avoiding the dangerous possibility of cooking the juice.  Left out
the orange blossom water this time -- with yesterday's batch of ~16 oz/3 tsp
and today's batch of ~8 oz/0 tsp, i should be able to attain many possible
concentrations and taste test to find the best.  (Hypothesis: ~16 oz/2 tsp is
the ideal ratio.)
