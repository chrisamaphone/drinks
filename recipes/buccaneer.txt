Buccaneer (based on Robert Hess's Captain's Blood)

3/4 oz aged rum (I just used Cruzan -- what i had on hand)
3/4 oz sherry (dry oloroso works well)
1/4 oz lime juice
1/4 oz simple
2 dashes Angostura bitters (or perhaps other aromatic?)

Invented 10-06-2013 for Chris based on the Captain's Blood, but modding it a bit
to include sherry, by request.  Worked surprisingly well!  Chris named it, for
the Pirates (who are totally in the playoffs!)

Weirdly doesn't work if you up the rum and sherry to 1 oz each.  I even tried
compensating for the reduced sourness by upping the lime juice to 1/2 oz, but
then it tasted flat, like it was missing something.  I think it was the bitters
-- the beauty of this drink is the way the bitters plays off the sherry, and
everything else is an accent.  (The simle might be for mouthfeel?  It doesn't
really make the drink sweet..)
