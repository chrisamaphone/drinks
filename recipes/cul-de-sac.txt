Cul-de-Sac (provisional title; invented Saturday, 2014-04-05)

3/4 oz cognac (Pierre Ferrand Ambre works well)
3/4 oz rye (Michter's)
3/4 oz sweet vermouth (Cinzano)
3/4 oz Campari

Made up for Tom when he, Michelle, and i were having cocktails chez moi.
He'd asked for a Boulevardier, or something like that, trusting my judgement,
and inspiration struck from having tried Spencer's "Perfect Sazerac" (half rye,
half cognac).  It works really well here, rounding everything out nicely,
keeping the Campari in check.  It adds a sweetness, but it's a dry sweetness
rather than a syrupy sweetness, which i feel both counters and complements the
sweetness in the Campari while mellowing yet supporting the bitter edge.  A++,
would drink again!  (I think the spiciness from the rye also brings out the best
in both the Campari and the sweet vermouth.)

Just made up the name Tuesday night after searching for French words for street.
Cul-de-Sac is a kind of turnaround, and half-and-half is a kind of return to the
roots of the early cocktail era when king cognac's throne was usurped by cheap
and plentiful spicy rye.
