Rosstail (my invention, 03-13-2010)

1.5 Domaine de Canton (ginger liqueur)
1.5 orange juice
.5 St. Germain
.5 Campari

Invented 03-13-2010, vaguely riffing on a Domaine de Canton Negroni, for
Ross just before we watched Sweeney Todd.

Came out a bit sweet on the first try, so i added some more Campari, which
made it too bitter, so i added a tiny bit extra Domaine de Canton, and it
was perfect.  Lesson: don't skimp on the Domaine de Canton right from the
start, and maybe be a bit short on the Campari -- or use Aperol instead?
