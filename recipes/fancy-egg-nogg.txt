Fancy Egg Nogg (via Brother Cleve)

2 oz oloroso sherry
1 oz cognac
1 tsp simple syrup
1 egg (whole)
3 oz milk (also whole -- or sub in 1 oz heavy cream for extra decadence)

First, dry shake everything but the milk.  Then shake over ice, hard, for at
least a couple minutes, til wonderful and frothy.  Serve in a collins or fizz
glass -- or a wine glass, if you're feeling hoity -- and garnish with a dusting
of fresh nutmeg.  (Depending on the glass size, it might make between 1 and 3
servings -- about 2 in wine glasses, about 1-1/2 in fizz glasses.)

This is supposed to be evocative of egg nogg as it would have been made at home
in like 1895.  (Somewhere around 1940, the final "g" inexplicably got dropped.)
I really like the nuttiness of the sherry, and it contributes a non-sickly kind
of sweetness to shore up the modest offering brought in by the 1 tsp simple.

NB: don't get like "cream" sherry or whatever -- that's sweetened after the fact
and probably nasty.
