Gin Fizz

2 oz gin
1 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz simple syrup
soda

Shake everything but the soda with cracked ice.  Then pour into a fizz glass
(something like 8-10 oz, straight sides), leaving an inch or so at the top,
and fill the rest glass with charged water.  Ideally use a soda siphon, but
at least fake it by shaking up some soda water while holding your hand over
the top and spraying a fine stream into the glass.  This is great fun :)

Variations:

Silver Fizz: add an egg white (do a dry shake first, with no ice!)
Golden Fizz: add an egg *yolk* (ditto on the dry shake)
Royal Fizz: add an entire egg (ditto again)

02-08-2012: I tried the Golden Fizz today to use up the egg yolk that was left
over after making a Pisco Sour.  Delicious!  It tastes surprisingly much like
a Ramos Gin Fizz, but it's waaaay simpler to make.  I guess a lot of it is the
texture and the citrus/sweet combo.  Maybe the egg lends a creamy flavor, as
well.
