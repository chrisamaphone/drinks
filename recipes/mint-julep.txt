Mint Julep

2 oz bourbon
1 tsp 2:1 simple
12-20 mint leaves

Put mint leaves and simple syrup in the cup (julep cup or Old Fashioned glass).
Press lightly to release the oils -- not enough to tear apart the mint leaves,
just enough to get some oils going.  Add 2 oz bourbon and stir.  Fill glass with
crushed ice and garnish with a mint sprig or few.  (Spank 'em first!)

A 16 oz cheater tin works well as a substitute julep cup.  That's how we did it
on the Core porch when i had these with Chris and Rob 2014-05-11.  (But somehow
i forgot to actually transcribe the recipe until August 24?)
