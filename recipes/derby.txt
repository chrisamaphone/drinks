Derby (from Cocktail, a Paul Harrington original)

2 oz bourbon
1/4 oz Benedictine
1 dash Angostura

Garnish: lemon twist.  Be sure to squeeze plenty of essential oils on top.

Made 12-03-2012 for Trevor.  I wasn't too impressed, honestly.  Mostly
tasted like bourbon.  Paled in comparison to the glorious Creole #1, also
tried that night.  It was fine, though.  Became a bit more interesting as it
warmed up (an observation due to Trevor).
