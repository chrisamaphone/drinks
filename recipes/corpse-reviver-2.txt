Corpse Reviver #2

1.5 gin
.75 lemon
.5 Lillet
.5 Cointreau
.125 absinthe

Garnish with a lemon twist.

Mmm!  A different recipe 8 found online called for .75 gin instead, which i
think makes it too Cointreauy -- might could adjust some other ingredients,
too.  There's an argument to be made that this ratio is a bit too ginny, or
at least a bit too voluminous, but i think it works well -- nicely balanced,
not too sweet, not too dry, just a touch of herbal.  Lillet is like a sweet
dry vermouth.

Not sure what's revivery or pick-me-uppy about it.. it's just a delicious
gin cocktail.  I guess the absinthe?

Also, absinthe is tasty!  Louche, louche!

10-20-2012: An NYTimes article[1] suggests (a) that this cocktail is supposed
to be equal parts everything but the absinthe (!?!), and (b) that it is much
better with Cocchi Americano, that being a closer aperitif wine to the original
bitter formulation of Kina Lillet.  Must try!

Another possible variation: absinthe rinse instead of shaking it in.

10-04-2014: Made it with the equal parts recipe for Vincent, and it was really
good!  She loved it, and i was surprised when i tried it at how bright, citrusy,
and balanced it was.  I think this drink is more related to the Last Word than
i ever gave it credit for.
