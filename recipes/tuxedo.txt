Tuxedo (from Oh Gosh [http://ohgo.sh/archive/old-tom-gin/],
        there from the Savoy Cocktail Book)

1 oz Old Tom gin (i used Hayman's)
1 oz dry vermouth (i used Dolin)
1/2 barspoon maraschino liqueur
1/4 barspoon absinthe
3 dashes orange bitters (i used Regan's)

Garnish: maraschino cherry and a lemon twist.

Honestly not super impressed with this one.  It's martini-ish, but complex.
I dunno, i think i still don't really like dry vermouth.  Whatcha gonna do?
(I wanted to make another Cocchi Americano cocktail, but all the ones i wanted
to make needed lemon.. actually, maybe it was just the Corpse Reviver #2, but i
really wanted to make it, so anything else was a disappointment..)

Chris liked it well enough.  It is rather complex, i suppose.  On further
tasting i do detect some really interesting notes from the orange bitters
marrying with the absinthe.  I don't get much from the maraschino, but i
imagine i'd notice its absence...

I think technically this is a Tuxedo #2 -- the original has fino sherry in
lieu of the dry vermouth.
