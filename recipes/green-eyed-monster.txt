Green-Eyed Monster

2 oz Irish whiskey
.5 oz sweet vermouth
.25 oz Pernod
dash Angostura bitters

Garnish: lemon twist.

Complex!  There's a whole host of whiskey-based drinks that we have the
capability to make now due to several relatively recent acquisitions,
including orange cura√ßao, orange bitters, absinthe, ... Irish whisky.

This drink would be better with absinthe, i bet -- even more herbal and
complex.  Want to remake it and see how it goes..

[Update: i'm pretty sure i did, and i'm pretty sure it was.]

[Update 04-29-2012: yep.  Vieux Carre goes really nicely with the lemon peel
essential oils and the herbs in the sweet vermouth.  Tom 7 liked it but for
the licorice flavor which he dislikes.  Also, used Dolin Rouge for extra good.]

Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Looks and tastes
a lot like a Bijou, sort of.  Similar composition to a Creole #2.  Our menu
was a little redundant.
