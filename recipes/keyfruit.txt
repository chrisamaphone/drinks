Keyfruit (virgin for Lea)

1.5 oz grapefruit
.5 oz lime (key, in fact)
.25 tsp simple syrup (rich)
1 dash bitters

Made for Lea 02-08-2011.  Verdict: very sour!  The bitters doesn't really
come through.  Maybe a bit more simple syrup?  But the lime and grapefruit
combo went well together!  (I think i did one before that had lemon as well.)
