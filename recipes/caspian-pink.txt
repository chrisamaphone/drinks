Caspian Pink (Summer Voelker's "Lady of the Night" feautured in Tasting Table,
http://www.tastingtable.com/entry_detail/ts/10125, made 08-25-2012 for fun.)

1 oz gin (Bluecoat, says Summer.. i bet Martin Miller's would be great!)
1 oz fresh tomato juice
3/4 oz Junmai sake (i used a junmai daiginjo)
1/2 oz Benedictine
1/4 oz lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt (like two pinches?)

Garnish: a sungold tomato.  (I actually used a giant ovular golden heirloom
tomato of some sort, from our CSA share.  I should really take a picture of
this one, as it's really something to see..)

To make the tomato juice, i basically pureed a tomato in a food processor,
but this necessicated a laborious fine-straining of the result.  Next time,
i'd like to try just "juicing" the tomato on our juicer and see what happens.

Wonderful flavors combine to make a savory yet refreshing drink.  I'm a huge
fan of tomato cocktails after the one i had in SF at Range (the Sungold Zinger),
and i'd like to try making/inventing more of them.  If the CSA keeps treating
us to a crop of tomatoes each week, it may just be my way of doing my part!

Update, 08-26-2012: Made it again, this time *right*.  Modifications:
    - ran out of Bluecoat gin, so i used Martin Miller's instead, which
      turned out to provide perfect peppery/vegetal base for a tomato drink
    - juiced the tomato on the juicer instead of pureeing it in the food
      processor -- took some effort to spin out the juice, but i got a full
      ounce out of one medium tomato, just enough with a touch to spare
    - topped the whole thing with a splash of seltzer water at the finish,
      bringing the flavors to life with a sparkle, letting the wonderful
      savory flavors dance on the tongue!

I call it an unequivocated success.
