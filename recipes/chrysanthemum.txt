Chrysanthemum (recommended by Allison @ Livermore for the request "absinthe-y")

2 oz dry vermouth
3/4 oz Benedictine
1/4 oz absinthe
[1 dash orange bitters?]

Garnish: orange peel.

Super tasty, despite being mostly dry vermouth, which neither Allison nor i
is/am particularly fond of!  The absinthe holds it together, i think, drawing
out the botanicals from the French vermouth and covering up that white winey
flavor.  Meanwhile, the Benedictine pulls out the honey notes in the dry
vermouth, in this case a nice Boissiere.

Maybe it didn't have orange bitters, just the peel -- i don't recall.  The
drink really hit the spot, though!
