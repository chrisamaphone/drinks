Death's Comeback -- Corpse Reviver #2216 (Embury)

Gin
St. Germain
Aperol
lemon juice
a few drops of absinthe

Aperol is like Campari, but less(?) bitter.  Tastes kind of like grapefruit.

03-13-2010: i've attempted this using 1 part of each, with Campari instead of
    Aperol.  came out a bit bitter -- maybe cut a few drops of the Campari for
    a few extra drops of St. Germain.  I didn't have any absinthe, either.

    Also, Tanqueray might be a bit strong for it.  What gin does Embury use?
