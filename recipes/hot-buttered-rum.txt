Hot Buttered Rum

1-1/2 oz rum (tried Blackstrap.. dark would be good.. maybe light, too?)
4-5 whole cloves
cinnamon stick
1 tsp simple
3-4 oz hot water
1 small pat butter

Mix all but the butter in a mug (ideally, a Bodum double-walled glass).
Slice the pat of butter in and stir until melted.  Dust with fresh nutmeg.
