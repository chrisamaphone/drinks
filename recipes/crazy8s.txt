Crazy 8

A crazy drink i made for 8 on 10-08-2010.

1.5 gin
1.5 Domaine de Canton
0.5 Campari
0.25 lime juice
Tonic water to taste

8 wanted something, so i whipped this up.  Rationale: he's a big fan of gin,
but didn't want just a gin and tonic.  He also seemed to really enjoy the
Domaine de Canton earlier, but thought it didn't come through strongly enough
in the original 1 oz Sour Wug, so i made sure to put in a healthy portion of
that.  Finally, he was always a big fan of the bitterness of the Campari, so
i added a splash to round the drink out.  No St. Germain in this one, but just
a bit of leftover lime juice to give it an edge.

Made for a light, refreshing drink with "the right amount of gin".  Served
over ice, topped with tonic water to give it some fizz.  Almost like my 1-1-1
Gin and Tonic, but with ginger liqueur in lieu of the lime.  But a bit of lime
anyway, to complete the flavor experience.
