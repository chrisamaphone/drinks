Martinez (from Cocktail)

1 gin
3/4 dry vermouth
1/4 Cointreau
2 dashes Angostura

Rob says Ango*sutra*, heh.  This was more complex than expected, probably due
to it being only alcohol.  I like it, similarly to how i like an Opera, but a
bit better.  Not as harsh and strong.  A little spicy from the Angostura, and
a little herbal from the vermouth (i used Dolin dry).

Online recipes suggest that a cocktail of the same name is often made using
maraschino liqueur instead of Cointreau.  That's actually almost an Opera,
if you sub orange bitters for the Angostura -- another variation widely to be
found.  So go figure -- i think these two drinks form a continuous category
that can enjoy a lot of variation.

10-29-2012: Tried the following variation at Chris's:

1 oz gin (Plymouth)
1 oz sweet vermouth (Cinzano)
1/4 oz maraschino liqueur
1 dash Angostura
1 dash Solerno

(I wanted two dashes orange bitters, but worked with what she had.)  There are
indeed a number of variations on this cocktail online!  Most of them seem to
involve sweet vermouth instead of dry, and frequently, maraschino liqueur
instead of Cointreau.  The ratio of gin to sweet vermouth varies all the way
from 2:1 to 1:2!  1:2 -- like a vermouth-based drink.  Anyway, the 1:1 was
pretty good, but i bet i'd like either the 2:1 or the 1:2 better, since either
one results in a drink more comfortable with what it is.  I do like the idea of
vermouth as a base -- more like the European apero tradition.
