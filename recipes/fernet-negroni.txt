Fernet Negroni

1 oz Plymouth gin
1 oz Fernet-Branca (instead of Campari)
.75 oz sweet vermouth

Garnish with an orange twist.

Wow, is this complex.  Tastes mostly like Fernet-Branca.  The orange oils
help balance things a bit.  I think Plymouth gin is used so it can stand up
to the Fernet -- Plymouth taste test revealed it to be very heavy-bodied
indeed.  I'm not totally convinced the sweet vermouth needs to be backed
off at all.  And i think i prefer the Cocktail-style negroni's orange wheel
to the orange twist.
