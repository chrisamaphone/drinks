Satan's Whiskers

3/4 gin
3/4 sweet vermouth
3/4 dry vermouth
1/2 Grand Marnier (or curaçao, for the "curled" variant)
1/2 orange juice
dash orange bitters

Garnish with an orange peel.

11-30-2011: Extremely orangey and extremely delicious!  Each of the different
manifestations of orange -- the curaçao (i made curled tonight), the orange
juice itself, the orange bitters, whatever orange peel essences went into the
vermouths, and the essential oils from the garnish -- offers its own, slightly
different interpretation of the flavor, and the sweet vermouth in particular
pulls them all together in a coherent whole.  I used Cinzano sweet vermouth,
which makes it not too sweet, and Dolin dry vermouth, which lends a sharpness
that balances the drink.  An even sharper dry vermouth might play okay.

I'd like to try making it without the orange bitters and see what kind of a
difference it makes -- this might be the kind of drink where that tiny bit of
subtlety changes everything.
