Phoebe Snow (from Boozehound)

1-1/2 oz cognac
1-1/2 oz Dubonnet
1/2 tsp absinthe
1 dash Angostura

Had Brian make a couple of these for us on 09-06-2014 at Jonathan's going-away
party.  Used a full barspoon of absinthe (which should be a tsp) for the two,
and it wound up being overpowering.  E&J VSOP for the brandy, Herbsaint for the
absinthe.  Should try again with a nicer cognac and/or smaller quantity of
absinthe (maybe even just a rinse?).

Recipes online omit the bitters.  I could see that -- it's a little redundant
and/or clashy with the absinthe.
