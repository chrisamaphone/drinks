Arak (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz dark rum
1-1/2 oz sherry
1 dash Angostura bitters

Garnish: lemon peel.

Alcohol-forward rum drink i dug up 05-07-2013.  Woody, nutty, complex... but
a little hard to drink.  I looked it up on the internet, and the only reference
i could find specified *sweet* sherry, which may have been my issue -- i only
had a dry sherry on hand.  *shrug*.  Also it was a pretty old sherry, so maybe
it had gone iffy.

I also flamed the lemon peel, because i'm incorrigible like that.

I also also wonder if i need a better dark rum for these alcohol-forward drinks.
(I think i used Cruzan Aged Rum for this one.  I also have Black Seal and have
used that occasionally.)

Oddly, has no arak in it.  Nor arrack, which is different.  ???
