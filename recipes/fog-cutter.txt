Fog Cutter (Trader Vic recipe, more or less)

1-1/2 oz light rum
1/2 oz brandy
1/2 oz gin
1-1/2 oz orange juice [2 oz originally.  too orangey...]
1-1/2 oz lime juice [1 oz originally.  also lemon, originally -- need to try!]
1/2 oz orgeat

1/2 oz amontillado sherry float

Garnish: mint sprig

Shake and serve over ice in a highball glass; float the sherry on top.

Made 07-10-2014 at the Core with lovely pecan-crusted trout dinner c/o Rob.
Tried 2 oz oj/1 oz lime at first, but decided a 1:1 ratio worked better --
more balanced, slightly more tart, and the orange doesn't take over so much,
so the orgeat shines through a bit more, not to mention the other bases.
We used E&J VS and its fruitiness worked well -- though i wonder if the XO
would complement the orgeat better!  (cf., Japanese Cocktail)

Summer of the tiki drink continues...
