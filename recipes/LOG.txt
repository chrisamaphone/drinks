        St. Germain Gin and Tonic

    New Year's Eve

    Purchased:
        Bitters!  Finally...
        Grenadine (or an approximation thereof -- pomegranate martini mix)

    Made:
        Bronx
        Saintly Maiden's Prayer
        (Brian) (Im)perfect Manhattan (Im- because he used the wrong garnish)
        Pegu (mmm, i love this one -- c.f. Pink Gin, but with more stuff)
        St. Germain French 77
        Old Fashioned (no cherry muddling, though!  bitters was key.)
        Ward Eight
        (Matt) Raspberry Lemondrop (for Katie -- limoncello, shrub, and soda)
        Apple Pie (didn't work so well subbing white rum + vanilla for dark rum)
        Death's Nuts
        St. Germain Gin and Tonic
        Milk Punch

01-01-2011:
    The Day After -- some simpler classics

    Made:
        Martini (i think it'd be better without throwing out the vermouth)
        Pink Gin (extraordinarily interesting for being basically just gin and
                  bitters!  squeeze of lime makes a big difference, i guess..)
        Raspberry Lemondrop
        Stone Sour (Whiskey Sour with a splash of orange juice)

01-05-2011: Bought some Aperol when i bought 8's present (Tanqueray #10).

-> somewhere in here, party at David's <-

01-10-2011:
    To purchase:
        Cheap bourbon (Ezra Brooks?  Jim Beam?)
        Light rum (Mount Gay?  Don Q?)
        Dark rum (Mount Gay?)

01-18-2011:
    Purchased (sq. hill):
        Ezra Brooks bourbon
        New Amsterdam gin
        Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth
        Martini & Rossi dry vermouth
        St. Germain
        Pernod

    Pernod is the big experimental purchase!  Couldn't find any more interesting
    vermouths -- all PLCB sells is Martini and Rossi and stuff that's worse.

    Made:
        One Spot (herbaceous and dry!  to the face!  taste complexity 5!)
        Jasmine (last week's drink, or this week's, sort of -- i'm front-

    Made:
        French 77s
        Aviations
        Veevual (1.5 gin, .75 lmn, .5 veev -- not quite right yet, too sour)
        Veevuello (1.5 gin, .5 lmn, .25 limoncello, .5 veev -- better, i think!
                   the limoncello, against all odds, accents the veev... i think
                   that Creme Yvette would work as well)
        Kempy Finn
