1.5 gin
.75 Campari
.25 Fernet-Branca

Garnish: orange-wrapped olive.

Holy crap, this is the perfect aperitif!  All of the ingredients shine through
in their own way -- the olive makes it savory, the campari makes it bitter..
olive and gin, gin and campari... and the Fernet-Branca gives it a minty finish
-- but without overtaking the drink!  Amazing!

The garnish is delicious, too, once you accept that it's food.

8 picked this one up at Zeus Cafe at Crystal Palace Hotel in Portland, with
Guy and Kate.  They made it with some crazy quina ingredient, instead of
Campari, but i like the Campari.  I like Campari again!  I think it works
better than Cynar in this drink because of the orange.

Bonal gentiane-quina.

07-31-2011: Can't remember what gin we used, but i don't think Blue Coat is
the right one.  Needs to be something that compliments the olive well.. a gin
that would be good in a martini.. Plymouth?


Kate's Apero (original)

1-1/2 oz gin
3/4 oz Bonal Gentiane-Quina
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca

Super delicious, even without garnish -- somehow, it tastes orangey already!
I guess the Bonal must have some orange essence?  But i always thought Bonal
tasted a little savory, too, hence its use in the Old Man River, which makes
the garnish make even more sense -- orange-wrapped olive, citrus oil and
savory!

Made a couple of these 01-12-2013 at the Confused Time Traveler NYE/13-13-13
party, 'cause David wanted something with gin and Fernet, since they ran out
of Fernet at H&H but had something on the menu combining the two.  I made one
for myself, as well, and i think another one, for ... uhh ... Rob!  Right.  I
suggested it to him not-too-subtly, being like, "do you have anything particular
you're in the mood for?  Or do you just want me to surprise you with something
complex and minty, ginny?", to which he responded, "... Yes!"  Wildly popular.
