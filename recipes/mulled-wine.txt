Mulled Wine (batch)

1 bottle (750 mL) basic red wine (not too tannic; i used Avia Pinot Noir)
1/4 cup honey
couple cinnamon sticks
few star anise petals
small handful of whole cloves
a few dashes of allspice
one whole orange, sliced
1/2 oz plum brandy

Stick it all in a pot, heat it up nearly to boiling, then simmer for a bit.
It feels like you should be careful not to burn it, but honestly, i think it's
pretty hard to screw this up.  The plum brandy adds a certain je ne sais quoi,
even though it's only a half oz in a whole bottle of wine.

Notes on technique: the 1/4 cup sweetener is important, to counteract the
concentration of acidity and bitterness that'll come with heating up wine.
The orange adds a bit more sweetness while also adding complexity via the
rinds.  This stuff is really gulpable, and a batch serves about 4-5 people
(i think some of the alcohol cooks off, reducing the overall volume a bit).

Made for New Year's Eve 12-31-2013.  Would like to try different sweeteners:
sugar is possible, but seems boring.  Maple syrup could be interesting!
