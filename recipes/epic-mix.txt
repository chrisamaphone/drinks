Epic Mix

1/2 oz Cointreau
1-2 dashes Angostura bitters
4-5 oz hot chocolate

Invented this at a Renshaw party, alongside the Wintry Mix (schnapps, hot
chocolate, shot of rum and froth it).  Really awesome flavor combination,
orange, spices, and chocolate!  Made a variation 04-15-2013 for Kat, using
almond-coconut milk and Ghirardelli hot chocolate powder.  Wonderful melding
of flavors: the coconut with chocolate reminiscient of a Girl Scout Samoa,
or a chocolate macaroon, or the fancy truffles from Eden; the almond with the
orange, playing up the light fruitiness of the nut; the orange with the
chocolate, a classic combination, "just like a Terry's Chocolate Orange", says
Kat; and the chocolate with the almond, a chocolate-covered delight.  The
spices from the Angostura tie it all together.  Very warming, calming, and
comforting evening drink.
