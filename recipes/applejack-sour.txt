Applejack Sour

2 applejack
1 lime juice
.5 simple syrup

Appley to the max!  Oh man, this is so great.  I think the lime brings out the
apple flavor.  (With grenadine instead of simple, it's a Jack Rose, and the
book claimed that the Jack Rose has very little apple flavor -- only the most
discerning palate would detect it.  I'm not so sure i believe it -- but then,
grenadine is a pretty strong flavor.)

Highly gulpable.  But also very sour -- green apple deliciousness.
