Caipirinha (from Cocktail, adapted)

1-1/2 to 2 oz cachaça
1 whole lime
1/4 oz simple syrup

Cut the lime into quarters and place in a chilled Old Fashioned glass.  Pour in
the simple, and muddle carefully.  Pour in the cachaça, and stir.  Fill glass
with crushed ice.

Simple, strong, and drinkable.  Surprisingly like a margarita, says Chris --
turns out cachaça's not *that* much like rum, almost more like tequila.  The
lime quarters were a bit tricky to muddle, but i got the hang of it eventually.

I'd like to try making one of these with granulated sugar, rather than simple
syrup.  Should make the muddling a bit easier, and i like the idea of extracting
essential oils from the rind through mild abrasion.  I watched a few videos
online, and the primary variation seems to be the manner of cutting the lime
into pieces.  Almost everybody does in fact use an entire lime.

Should also try it with 2 oz of cachaça.  Maybe a better cachaça, too -- Leblon?

2014-04-12: Tried it with 2 oz of Leblon cachaça and granulated turbinado
("Sugar in the Raw"), cutting the lime into eights like i've seen on some
videos.  Worked great, tasted great!  Using a granulated sugar in lieu of
simple did indeed simplify the muddling.  Ordered a Lewis Bag so i can do
the crushed ice properly.  Still need to try a SxS of Leblon and Pitu.

Q: cachaça : rum :: tequila : ???  sotol, maybe?  (Getting more behind this
"tequila is just agave brandy" thing.. if cachaça is just sugar cane brandy.)
