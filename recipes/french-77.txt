French 77

1 St Germain
.5 lemon juice
4 (or so) sparkling wine (we used a cava, i believe)

Garnish with a lemon twist.

A twist on the French 75 champagne cocktail.  Tastes like an extremely well-
crafted Verdi Spumante.  You can make a bunch of them by mixing the still
ingredients all at once, pouring them into several glasses, and then topping
off each with the bubbly.
