Coffee Cocktail (from the Cocktail Spirit)

1-1/2 oz port
1-1/2 oz brandy
1 tsp simple
dash Angostura
whole egg

Dry shake, shake with ice, strain into a wine goblet.  Totally yummy, though
it has almost nothing to do with coffee.  Has a sliiiiight bit of roasted
woodiness to it, perhaps from the brandy, or the brandy/port combo.  Mildly
reminiscient of the Fancy Egg Nogg we're all so fond of, though more bitters
and less milk, and with port instead of sherry.  An entirely excellent after-
dinner drink.

Actually does call for a garnish of grated nutmeg, at least in some written
recipes, and which i neglected.  That would be most welcome, i think.

Also, i used a tawny port.  Robert Hess used a ruby port.  I have no idea
what the difference is, except that i think the ruby port makes it look more
purple than brown.
