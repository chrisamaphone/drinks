Pisco Sour

2 oz pisco
1 oz lemon
1/2 oz simple
egg white
dash or two of Angostura

Dry shake or cappuccino froth all ingredients, shake with cracked ice, and
pour into a wine goblet (it's too big for a cocktail glass with the expansion
of the egg white into foam).

Garnish with a lemon twist.  Optionally dot the top foam layer with 4-5 drops
of Angostura and use a toothpick to carve them into an interesting design.
But serve as quickly as possible after shaking and pouring, so the imbiber
can watch the head separate out from the rest of the drink in a stout-like
fashion.

Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Quite popular,
somewhat annoyingly -- egg whites are a pain to work with, and they keep
you from doubling up drinks.  But we managed, and people were happy :)
