Presidente (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz light rum
1/2 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz Cointreau
1/2 oz dry vermouth
1 dash grenadine

Garnish: lemon peel.  (Flaming, optionally.)

04-16-2013: Continuing the rum study, a totally non-tiki refreshing aperitif
cocktail to rival any of my favorite gin concoctions!  I like this a lot more
than i expected to, given the dry vermouth, but it's a small enough quantity
that it just plays this wonderful complexifying role with the Cointreau and
the lemon.  The grenadine makes for a beautiful blush pink color and accents
the sweetness of the other ingredients.

Also, flaming garnishes are really fun :)

Recipes i find online invariably omit the lemon juice, and frequently use
cura√ßao instead of Cointreau, often too much.  I could imagine trying it
without the lemon, but i really like what the lemon adds.
