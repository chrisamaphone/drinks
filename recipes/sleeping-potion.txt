Sleeping Potion

1 oz applejack
1 scant barspoon honey
3 dashes orange flower water
4-5 oz chamomile tea

Serve in a double-walled glass (or perhaps a toddy glass); garnish with a
flamed orange peel.

Invented Wed, 04-10-2013 for Kat to help her go to sleep.  I had a Sidecar.
Both drinks performed admirably!
