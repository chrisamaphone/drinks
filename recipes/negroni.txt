Negroni (from Cocktail)

1 gin
1 sweet vermouth
1 Campari

Garnish with an orange wheel.  To make it "truly Italian", squeeze a bit of
juice from the orange wheel before dropping it into the glass -- the hint of
orange sweetness will balance the Campari's brisk bitterness to make a perfect
though hard-hitting aperitif.

8 liked it a lot.  He loves Campari.
