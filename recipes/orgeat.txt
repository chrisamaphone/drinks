"Blasphemously easy" homemade orgeat
(http://craftcocktailsathome.com/2013/04/a-blasphemously-easy-recipe-for-the-best-homemade-orgeat/)

8 oz almond milk (low sodium preferred)
4 oz sugar (i.e., 8 tbsp)
8 drops orange flower water
8 drops almond extract

A simple, quick, easy recipe that might be better than anything else you can
make at home, on account of the commercial almond products' bitter almond
origins, which have more benzaldehyde in them in addition to the cyanide.
I found this quite sweet, almondy, and generally tasty by itself, but it
felt like it kinda got lost in both the Mai Tai and the Japanese Cocktail.
But heating it is a no-no -- so how else to concentrate that almond flavor?
More sugar?  More extract?

The almond milk that i first tried (07-02-2014) was Engine 2 unsweetened
original, since it had pretty low sodium (120 mg) and very simple ingredients,
but who knows, maybe it is actually a crappy almond milk [for this purpose]!
To try next:

    - Pacific brand, available at Whole Foods, and recommended by the original
      recipe above, despite its high sodium content (160 mg?)

    - SO Delicious Almond+Plus, also available at Whole Foods, which boasts
      even lower sodium content (95 mg iirc), but has weird extra proteins
      (pea protein etc.?)

    - maybe more sugar?  i really don't know how to adjust, because i don't
      know how this stuff is supposed to taste.. need to do some scouting,
      like at Smuggler's Cove..

07-19-2014: Tried the Pacific brand today.  Verrrry different!  Because of the
roastiness and the vanilla.  Almost like cake batter.  Also i basically
standardized on 1/4 tsp orange flower water and almond extract, which is more
than 8 drops i think, but more repeatable.
