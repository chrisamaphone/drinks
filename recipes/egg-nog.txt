Egg Nog (batch recipe, based closely on Jeff Morgenthaler's Clyde Common recipe)

6 large eggs
9 oz (by volume) granulated sugar (or less?)
1/2 tbsp freshly-grated nutmeg
6 oz brandy (4 oz VS, 2 oz XO)
7.5 oz sherry (4 oz amontillado, 3.5 oz oloroso)
18 oz whole milk
12 oz heavy cream

Mix everything together slowly in a large bowl, then refrigerate for a few hours.
Makes a half gallon.

Serve with a dusting of fresh nutmeg.

Made this for New Year's Eve 12-31-2013.  Turned out *really* good!  I think the
oloroso/amontillado combination is aces.  The XO brandy was also key to the
velvety smoothness.

12-26-2017: blended up a half batch for Lovas household Boxing Day festivities, but lacking heavy cream, I used a squirting of whipped cream.  I also decreased the sugar a touch to compensate — just an ounce less or so.   But nevertheless, it came out a bit sweeter than I’d have liked.  For future reference, maybe cut the sugar to 1/2 or 2/3.
