Bixiou -- Bitter Maiden (Embury)

Yellow Chartreuse
Campari
blackberry syrup
10 dashes Peychaud's Bitters

Might be missing some ingredients.. i think that's it, though.  Interestingly
bitter.  Jeffrey describes Chartreuse as a gift from the gods.  Elixir Vegetal,
made from a secret recipe for medicinal purposes only.  Eventually morphed into
Green Chartreuse, a 55% liqueur, and later, Yellow Chartreuse, a more accessible
40% liqueur.
