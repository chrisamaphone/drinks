Corn'n'Oil (from Bitters)

2 oz blackstrap rum (e.g., Cruzan)
1/2 oz falernum
1/4 oz lime juice
couple dashes Angostura

Build in an old-fashioned glass over ice.  Stir.  Garnish with a lime wedge.

Pretty strong for my tastes, and a little sweet.  Varying the proportions to
a typical sour-type cocktail, though:


Blackstrap Sour (Embury?)

2 oz blackstrap rum
1 oz lime juice
1/2 oz falernum
couple dashes Angostura

Shake over ice, serve up.  Garnish with a lime squeeze.

Now this is wonderful!  The citrus pulls things together, in my opinion.
Buttery and delicious.  I think Embury probably made it with Demerrara simple,
though, or something.

Chris was a big fan, in particular, and i rediscovered it.
