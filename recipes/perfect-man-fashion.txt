Perfect Man Fashion (made up 12-21-2013 [the solstice!] for Mr. and Mrs. Saghy)

1-1/2 oz bourbon (used Cleveland whiskey, and it worked well)
1/2 oz sweet vermouth
1/2 oz dry vermouth
1/2 oz Cointreau
1 dash aromatic bitters

Garnish: maraschino cherry.  (Orange peel would work as well, i think.)

Sort of a cross between a Perfect Manhattan and an Old Fashioned -- comes out
really nice!  Not so aggressively spirit-forward as a straight up Manhattan, but
also not as cloying as an Old Fashioned.  Cointreau and dry vermouth play really
well together, binding the other ingredients together in a very pleasant way.

It was an invention of necessity owing to the lack of citrus at the Saghy manse.
I'm quite happy with how it turned out, though.  I wonder if there's something
it's close to in the literature.. (Sweet vermouth/dry veromuth/Cointreau makes
me think of a Satan's Whiskers, but that's with gin, plus orange bitters rather
than aromatic, and also with fresh juice [of orange].  Bourbon/dry vermouth is
reminiscient of a Chartreuse Cocktail, but eh, it's quite different i think..)

Maybe i should try this at the parents' house with a flamed orange peel!  Or
lemon, maybe.. would that work?  It would introduce something new to the drink,
rather than playing off something already extant, but maybe that could be good..
