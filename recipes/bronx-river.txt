Mostly gin!  Kind of like a martini, but more aperitify.  Sweet vermouth is
really better than dry, i think, and the rest rounds it out and makes it a
nicely balanced drink.  What the hell, though: 1:2:4:*16* ratio??  Or maybe
it's really .5:1:2:8, which is almost the 1:2:8 of Embury, but not of the
right things: it's like.. 1 sweet, 2 sour, 4 herbal modifier, 16 base.  Weird.

update 06-08-2012: waaay better with Martin Miller's.  At least, better than
with Bell Ringer, which is mostly just strong and alcoholic.  The Martin
Miller's really lends a beautiful summery flavor to it, almost like fresh
basil.  Quality!
