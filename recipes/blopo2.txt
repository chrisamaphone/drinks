Week 6: the Aviation

As far as cocktails are concerned, the week begins on Saturday, and the Aviation, the subject of my first content blog post, comes from Week 6, February 5th through February 11th.

Aviation week was inspired by two things:

    1. I spent the tail end of Winter Break (or really, the nose beginning of the Spring semester) traveling by plane to Orlando, to Austin, and back to Pittsburgh, so aviation was fresh on my mind, and
    2. While in Austin, i managed to pick up a bottle of Luxardo maraschino liqueur, the key ingredient in an Aviation (shh, don't tell the PLCB)
