14th Arrondissement (something i made up)

2 oz Waterloo gin
3/4 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz house-made grenadine
1/2 oz St. Germaine
1 dash Peychaud's bitters

Made up Tuesday, 03-03-2015 while watching Star Trek: Voyager with Brian.
We watched the two-parter entitled the Killing Game, which took place largely
in a holodeck simulation in a French town called St. Claire during World War II.
We made up drinks using only French ingredients -- Brian's was a Manhattan-esque
drink he called the St. Claire, and mine was a sort of twist on the Ninth Ward,
primarily designed to use the grenadine which i'd given him as a Christmas gift,
but noticed to be Ninth Ward-esque about halfway through.  Tasty, fruity!  Had
to up the gin to 2 oz from 1-1/2 oz.

The name is a bit of an homage to its post-hoc origins.  Also, i thought it may
have been the arrondissement Chris lived in the summer of 2011, but after a bit
more reflection and map-reading, i think it may have been the 15th.  Whatever --
the 14th has Montparnasse!
