Fourth Regiment (from Raising the Bar, with Jamie Boudreau)

1-1/2 oz quality high-proof bonded rye
1-1/2 oz sweet vermouth
1 dash Peychaud's bitters
1 dash orange bitters
1 dash celery bitters

Garnish: lemon peel, squeezed and swabbed around the inside of the glass
before pouring to fully incorporate the essential oils into the drink.

Amazingly well-balanced spirit-forward cocktail!  Chris and Lizzie both liked
it a lot.  I used my Michter's rye, since it was the highest proof i happened
to have.  I think this is the best cocktail i've ever made with it -- usually
it's too strong, like in a Sazerac or whatever.

For me, the first thing to hit was the celery bitters, but having spoken its
piece, it backs off to give way to the sweet, woody, herbalness of the remaining
ingredients.  I think the Peychaud's works well by providing a link between
the rye and the orange bitters -- it's a sweeter bitters than Angostura, but
spicy like a nice rye.

Could probably do this with 1 oz each of the rye and the sweet vermouth, but
then it's a pretty small cocktail.  Maybe this is a case for the oft-ignored
1-1/4 oz jigger?
