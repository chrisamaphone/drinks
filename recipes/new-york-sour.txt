New York Sour

2 oz rye
1 oz lemon
1/2 oz simple
[optional: egg white]
floater of red wine

Make a whiskey sour as usual -- dry shake if you're using egg white -- then pour
it over ice in a rocks glass and float about half an oz of dry red wine on top.
You can use a barspoon (or even a regular spoon) to control the speed of the
pour in order to make it float on top.  Made some simple tasty ones at the Core
04-10-2015 after being scared indoors by #shadysidesmash (and also signing my
corrective proposal on the 5829 Holden offer produced by Annette).  Lemon and
wine, tasty together, just like in a hot mulled wine.  A really nice twist on
an otherwise simple sour!

To try: a floater of Dubonnet!  With what base spirit, though?  Cognac?
