Lea's Mom's drink (my invention, 09-17-2010)

1 Domaine de Canton (ginger liqueur)
1.5 orange juice
1.5 St. Germain
.3 Campari

Invented 09-17-2010 for Lea's Mom, based closely on the Rosstail, but with
more St. Germain and less Domaine de Canton, because she said she liked the
St. Germain best, wanted a sweet "girly" drink.  Just a touch of Campari to
round it out, spice it up, but not too much..
