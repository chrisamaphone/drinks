Brooklyn

1.5 bourbon
.75 dry vermouth
.125 (dash) maraschino liqueur
.125 (dash) Amer Picon

Garnish with a lemon squeeze.

A variation on the Manhattan.  Two reasons i was excited to try this out:
(1) i finally got a decent dry vermouth, Dolin -- kind of on the sweeter
side, but smooth and not so bad-white-winey, and (2) i picked up some
Bittermen's Amere Nouvelle off of drinkupny.com; it's supposed to be in
the style of Amer Picon, and something of a "replica", but sources differ
on how close it actually is.

Verdict: not a bad drink, but a little too sweet, i think.  I experimented
with doubling the dashes to splashes, but that made it even worse.  A better
experiment: substitute rye for the bourbon?  Anything that uses a dash for
accent feels a little underwhelming to me, usually...
