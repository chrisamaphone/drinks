Opera

2 gin
1/2 Dubonnet
1/4 maraschino
dash orange bitters

Garnish with a lemon twist.
(I actually twisted a lemon circle, to make a sort of a bowtie!)

I was a fan!  8 not so much.  Too ginny for him.  I say it's a good,
strong aperitif -- just one, just before dinner.  It's got some complexity,
but it's nicely sweet.  Plymouth was our gin of choice.  Martin Miller's?
May have come out too sweet.

This is another drink where i find the orange bitters plays a role.
