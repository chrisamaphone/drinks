Swagger (from Raising the Bar, with Jamie Boudreau)

1-1/2 oz gin
1/2 oz Dubonnet
1/2 oz Rabarbaro Zucca
1/2 oz grapefruit juice

Garnish: lime squeeze.

Pitched as a nice, light, refreshing brunch cocktail.  It's surprisingly close
to a negroni -- the grapefruit juice brightens it up a bit, but not as much as
you might expect!  It's really not a citrusy cocktail.  Tastes almost like it
has Campari in it, with the bittersweet Zucca and the bittercitrus grapefruit.
Very nice, slightly sweeter, slightly less intense negroni.  Adding a bit of
juice from the lime squeeze brightens it up even more.
