Sherry Twist (from Cocktail)

1 oz sherry (they say amontillado, i used oloroso)
1/2 oz dry vermouth
1/2 oz brandy
1/2 oz Cointreau
1/2 oz lemon

Garnish: lemon peel.

Made this for Lizzie at 09-04-2013 intimate aperos.  Kind of like a sidecar,
with more depth and complexity.  More sour than i'd imagined, but 1/2 oz is
a fair shake of lemon i suppose.  You can basically think of this as 1.5 parts
sidecar(ish) mixed with 1 part sherry, with a half part of dry vermouth to tie
it all together -- the botanicals provide the link to the sidecar's citrusiness,
and the wine base provides the link to the complexifying sherry.  I guess
brandy, sherry, and dry vermouth all share some commonalities in composition,
flavor.  It's a cocktail that can be analyzed a number of ways, and i like that
about it :)
