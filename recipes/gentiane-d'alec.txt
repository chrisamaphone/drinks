Gentiane d'Alec (by Alec at Livermore)

1-1/2 oz dry vermouth
1/2 oz blanco tequila
1/2 oz gentian liqueur (Salers)
1/4 oz Strega
1/4 oz Cointreau
1 dash lemon juice
1 dash simple syrup

Wednesday, 05-21-2014, Brian and i were hanging out at Livermore getting drinks.
I was experiencing tooth pain (this would turn out to be just days before my
Memorial Day Weekend 2014 hospital fiasco), and thought some strong drinks would
soothe things, or at least deaden the senses.  When i asked for a bitter,
gentian-based drink, Alec, one of the bartenders that night, whipped up this
totally custom random thing that tasted *amazing* using Salers.  I'd totally
forgotten that it had tequila in it, but i do recall that it needed something
to punch it up a bit, since he started from a dry vermouth base essentially.

Alec said Strega and Cointreau are partners in crime.  That's something i'll
have to play around with.. never would've thought of it, i don't think!

Anyway, he wrote down the recipe for me as best as he could remember it, and so
i'm digitizing it here for posterity and the benefit of future generations.
(The goofy name is entirely my fault.)
