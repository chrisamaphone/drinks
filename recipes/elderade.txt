Elderade (my invention, 03-13-2010)

Kind of an Elderflower lemonade.

2 lemon juice
2 St. Germain
8-10 leaves of basil

Muddle the basil leaves with 1 part each St. Germain and lemon juice.  Strain
off into a rocks glass filled with ice.  Add remaining part each of St. Germain
and lemon juice, stir, and garnish with a sprig of basil.

Invented 03-13-2010 for Chris, as a kind of alcoholic lemonade without sugar.
The challenge was "something with lemon and basil", and having just purchased
my first bottle of the "bartender's ketchup", it was the obvious choice to use
as a mixer!  It was met with great delight.  Even Lea tried it, and it was the
least bad alcoholic thing she'd ever had.  She said it smelled like those sour
lemon candies that Altoids makes.
