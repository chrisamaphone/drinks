Elixir of Truth (provisional title; invented 2014-04-08)

1-1/2 oz smooth gin (Hayman's Old Tom)
3/4 oz Dubonnet
3/4 oz Bitter Truth EXR Elixir

Brian wanted me to make something up using the Elixir Krauterliqueur, so i came
up with this Negroni variation.  Started with Jamie Boudreau's golden ratio of
1-1/2, 3/4, 1/4, but after a stir and a taste, decided it was way too Dubonnet-
heavy.  Upped the EXR twice by 1/4 oz each time until it tasted balanced at this
ratio.  It's kind of like the thing i made up for Tom the other day, where it's
like a Negroni-type cocktail but with double base.  (I just decided to call it
a Cul-de-sac.)
