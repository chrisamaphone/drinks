All Betts Are Off (via Brian)

1-1/2 oz mezcal
3/4 oz Dolin Blanc
3/4 oz Yellow Chartreuse
2 dashes grapefruit bitters

Garnish: grapefruit peel

Brian and i made this at his place 11-27-2013 pre-Thanksgiving-trip-evening,
but lacking certain ingredients, we modified it to use 3/4 oz Cocchi Americano
instead of 3/4 oz Dolin Blanc, and 2 dashes Regan's orange bitters instead of
grapefruit bitters.. and no garnish.  Worked really well nonetheless -- the
herbal qualities of the two modifiers temper the smokiness, blending into a
really nice golden smoothness.

Gaz Regan says, "[Dolin Blanc] brings a creaminess to this quaff... it acts
like a white fluffy mattress on which the other ingredients play."  We'll have
to try it done right sometime :)
