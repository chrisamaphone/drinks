St. Domaine

Made for Kempy on 10-08-2010

1.25 St. Germain
1.25 Domaine de Canton

Shake with ice.  Strain into a small scotch glass with a single ice cube,
and serve.

Kempy wanted something with St. Germain and Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur,
so i just mixed the two (Chris's suggestion), in equal parts.  It's quite a
sweet drink, and definitely something of a cordial, but the two flavors just
about mellow each other out perfectly.  It's good for an audience like the
Kemp, one that wants something sweet.
