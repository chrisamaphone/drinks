Smoking Gun (from the Dalva secret bar)

1-1/2 oz smoky scotch
1/2 oz Gran Classico
1/2 oz Cynar
1+ dash Peychaud's bitters
1+ dash black walnut bitters

Serve in an Old Fashioned glass with a large, perfectly clear ice cube.

Reconstructed 2014-03-30 with Matt, but it's not quite balanced right.
We totally guessed at the ratios based on my intuitions.

Supposed to be made with coffee bitters, which i attempted to approximate
through New Orleansianness and dark nuts.
