Cuban #1 (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz light rum
1/2 oz lemon juice
1/4 oz maraschino liqueur
1 dash grenadine
1 dash orange bitters

Garnish: lemon twist.

Made 04-15-2013 as the start of a study in rum.  Kind of like the Aviation
of rum -- subtle and complex, but sweet and refreshing.  The small quantities
of different sweeteners come together in a nice way, complexified by the
bitters.  When i made it, i flamed a lemon peel for fun.  Made for a
surprisingly sour cocktail give the proportions..
