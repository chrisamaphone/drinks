1 dash celery bitters

Found this while looking for a good stirred cocktail involving Chartreuse.
A commenter on one of Jamie Boudreau's videos tried to "break" his 1-1/2,
3/4, 1/4, plus an optional dash of bitters "golden ratio" rule of making
aperitif-style cocktails, but found to his dismay that the drink worked
wonderfully.  I'm not at all surprised, and when i saw the ingredients
listed, i knew it would be just what i was looking for tonight anyway!

Kind of like the Emerald Martini i've made before, but more complex and
better balanced.  I threw a castelvetrano in there after a few sips, and
it made a fine garnish -- it brings out the savory in the celery and the
green in the Chartreuse.  Celery bitters plays more nicely with the Green
Chartreuse than i'd have guessed.. something to play with more?
