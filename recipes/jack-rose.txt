Jack Rose

2 Applejack
1 lime juice
.5 grenadine

Quite sweet (suite?).  We used Rose's, which maybe fits the name, but is
fundamentally not very tasty.  I prefer the Applejack Sour since it lets
the lime-induced sour apple flavors come through more clearly.  But a better,
subtler grenadine could make for an interesting combo.

Turns out Cocktail was right about the Jack Rose having very little apple
flavor!  (c.f., applejack-sour.txt)
