Smokey Mac (invented 01-17-2012)

1-1/2 peaty scotch [used Irish whiskey the first time]
3/4 dry vermouth
2 dashes celery bitters

A little bit too celery-like, when made with Irish whiskey.  Used Tullamore
Dew 12, being the harshest whiskey i could muster.  I think it would work
better with a really peaty islay malt, like Laphroaig.
