New Orleans is Drowning (a Chris McMillan original)

1 oz bourbon
1 oz cognac
3 dashes Angostura
1 sugar cube
Campari-lined glass

Prepare like a Sazerac, basically -- muddle the sugar cube with the bitters and
some water, pour in the spirits, stir over ice, then strain into a Campari-lined
glass.

Chris McMillan made this up when he was staying with the deGroffs in New York
helping to open Pegu Club in August(?) 2005, shortly after Katrina hit.  It was
originally a joke, but became a real drink.  It's designed to represent all the
different groups whose heritage makes up New Orleans: bourbon for the Americans,
cognac for the French, sugar for the sugar farmers, Angostura for the tiki
heritage coming from the Gulf, and Campari for the Italians (apparently a major
component of New Orleans, i guess?  I forget the story there..).

He made one for me when i visited him at Kingfish in New Orleans for Mardi Gras
2014 (on Sunday, 03-01-2014, two days before Mardi Gras proper).  I'd introduced
myself and asked for something off-menu.  Him: "Like what?"  Me: "Strong, herbal
.. like a sazerac, but not a sazerac!"  I'd say he nailed it.
