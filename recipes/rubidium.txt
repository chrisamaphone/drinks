Rubidium

1-1/2 oz gin (Martin Miller's)
3/4 oz Rabarbaro Zucca
1/2 oz lemon juice
1/8 oz Pernod

Shake over ice, double-strain into a Pernod-rinsed glass, and garnish with a
flamed lemon peel.

Made it up for 8 on 05-27-2013.  He wanted something aperitify.  I wanted to
make a Sidecar.  But he also wanted Zucca.  So i kinda threw out the whole
Sidecar idea but sort of didn't.  Started with 1/2 oz of Zucca, but decided
it wasn't enough upon tasting.  Also the Pernod wasn't really coming through,
hence the rinse.  Came out remarkably balanced!  Lemon as an accent.

8 says: "whoa, whoa.. taste complexity 6, but extremely balanced!", "taste
complexity 6, mix complexity 5".

The name is a little dumb.  Was never my strong suit..
