Stregasaurus (made up by Brian to empty some bottles; named by Chris 2015-03-07)

1-1/2 oz gin
1 oz sherry
3/4 oz Strega

Brian made this up a week ago or so to use up some bottles that were nearly
empty, and i tweaked the ratios to the above.  Chris named it offhandedly when
i started to explain it to her at Acacia 03-07-2015.  The Strega is the binding
agent that connects the herbaceous gin with the almost-sweet and nutty sherry.
Surprisingly satisfying!
