Sour Wug

a riff on the elderade, for Dannelio, 10-08-2010

1.5 Lime juice
1.5 St. Germain
1 Domaine de Canton

Shake until ice cold.  Serve up, in a champagne glass.  Classy, refreshing.
Delicious.  Add .5 Domaine de Canton for a more gingery experience (preferred
by Dannels and Eights alike).

Named by Dannel.
