Affinity (from Cocktail)

3/4 oz scotch
3/4 oz sweet vermouth
3/4 oz dry vermouth
2 dashes Angostura

Garnish with a lemon peel.

Pretty sweet for not having that much in the way of sweet ingredients.  I guess
it doesn't really have any *bitter* ingredients -- it's kind of like a Negroni
with no real bitter component.  I did forget to shake in the Angostura, though,
and just drizzled it on top, so i dunno if that was enough..
