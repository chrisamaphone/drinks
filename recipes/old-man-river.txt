Old Man River (invented by 8, 01-17-2012)

1-1/2 savory gin (Catoctic Creek)
3/4 Bonal Gentiane-Quina
{1/4 Suze}
1-2 dashes celery bitters (careful: don't overdo it!)

Garnish with a Castelvetrano olive.

Cross between Kate's apero and a martini.  Pleasantly savory!  Bonal is so
nice -- it provides the perfect spicy, buttery, rich counterpoint to the
celery bitters.

Update, later: also nice with some black peppercorns.

Update, 10-06-2012: Let it be known that -- and this may have been decided
earlier, but was lost to the sands of time -- this drink requires 1/4 oz of
Suze.  It's too savory otherwise, but adding the Suze doesn't make it any
less savory -- it just makes it more other things, and those things wind up
being great.

Update, 10-10-2012: For a nice variation, substitute hop bitters (homemade by
Kyle) for the celery bitters.  We call this the Old Man Frogger, because it's
so hoppy/French.  Or maybe the Hop Man River.
