Taming of the Shrhubarb (original, named by Tom 7)

1-1/2 oz vegetal gin (e.g., Hendricks)
1/2 oz beet shrub
1/4 oz lemon juice
2 dashes rhubarb bitters

Garnish: lemon peel or twist.

To make the beet shrub, macerate one cup chopped beets (lightly cooked -- 25
minutes @ 400 F in foil) with one cup sugar for one day, then add about a half
cup white vinegar -- to taste.

Flavorful without being in-your-face -- nicely balanced, i think.  Maurer was
surprised it was so good, and Tom 7 liked it as well.  Definitely beety, but not
*too* beety.
