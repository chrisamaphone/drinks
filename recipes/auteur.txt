1.5 gin (Beefeater)
.75 Kronan Swedish punsch [i used Velvet Falernum]
.75 Bittermens Amère Nouvelle
.75 Amaro Ramazotti
.25 Yellow Chartreuse

Stir with ice, serve up.  No garnish required.

The chartreuse almost steals the stage, even at a quarter ounce!  But the
Ramazotti and the Amère Nouvelle trade orange notes and herbals nicely.  I
bet it's more complex with the proper punsch, but falernum did the trick of
sweetening with a bit of spice.

A fun drink, and quite complex even as i made it.  Good digestif after a nice
spicy meal -- in the case of today, after a heavily-chipotle'd refried bean
burrito.
