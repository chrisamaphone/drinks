Blue Basil Martini

1.25 Bluecoat gin
1 grapefruit juice
.25 St. Germain
2 basil leaves

Shake hard.  Garnish with 2 basil leaves.

Delicious!  Tastes like basil first, grapefruit last, and maybe gin somewhere
in the middle...?  Recipe due to Eleven, Pittsburgh's premier fancy restaurant
in the Big Burrito restaurant group.

8 thought it was like a better Death's Comeback.  The grapefruit certainly
makes it similar, but in a crazy sort of intentional way.
