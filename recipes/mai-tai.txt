Mai Tai (Trader Vic style?)

2 oz Jamaican rum [maybe 1-1/2]
  - or: 1 oz Jamaican rum, 1 oz sweeter dark rum
    (e.g., 1 oz Smith & Cross Navy Strength Jamaican, 1 oz Gosling's Black Seal)
    mixing rums is the key to tiki success!
3/4 oz lime
1/2 oz cura√ßao
1/2 oz orgeat
[1/4 oz rich simple?]

Made for the first time at womcave impromptu tiki cocktail party 07-02-2014.
Used a volumetric variation on the "blasphemously simple" orgeat recipe:

    8 oz almond milk (lowest sodium you can find)
    4 oz sugar (i.e., 8 tbsp)
    8 drops orange flower water
    8 drops almond extract

I thought it could do with a bit more sweetness, so maybe the 1/4 oz simple is
necessary.  I wanted to try it without first.  Next time i'll try it with.

As an experiment, i made Rob's with 1-1/2 oz rum instead of 2 oz, and it seemed
maybe more balanced, less rum forward, but not clearly better, and certainly not
more orgeat-y.  *shrug*, maybe the simple actually brings out more flavors?

For reference, the rum i used was Smith and Cross navy strength, which is kinda
bold and assertive.

I don't yet understand tiki, but this was a good first step!

07-20-2014: Perfected it!  And leveled up in tiki drinks, by mixing rums.  I'd
decided that the Smith and Cross Navy Strength Jamaican was a bit too strong and
a bit too pungent, and after last night's Planter's experiment with Lyndsey,
where the Smith and Cross was like suuuuper rough and the Gosling's was waaaay
easy drinking, i decided to mix the two!  Sweet, but complex!  And perfect.
No simple syrup needed (using orgeat #2).  1 oz of each makes for a very nicely
balanced Mai Tai.
