Remember the Maine

2 oz rye (Michter's is nice and spicy)
3/4 oz sweet vermouth
2 barspoons Cherry Heering
1/2 barspoon absinthe

Garnish: a cherry.

Pretty typical whiskey cocktail, with a bit of added complexity, mostly from
the absinthe.  I can't say the Cherry Heering stands up too strongly in the
face of the sweet vermouth, but it's definitely not just a Manhattan.

I learned making this drink that a barspoon holds a teaspoon.

http://www.adventuresincocktails.com/2010/02/14/remember-the-maine-a-1933-classic-cocktail-from-charles-h-baker/ suggests using Dolin Blanc instead of sweet vermouth.  (I used Cinzano, which may have similar cleanliness properties.)
