Minty Nail
(or: Herbaceous Nail)

1 oz Fernet Branca
1 oz Drambuie

Stir, serve in a small rocks glass over ice.

Warm, yet cool.  An excellent digestif!

(invented 05-15-2012?)

Brought this one out again 02-15-2013 for Trevor, who requested something with
Drambuie.  Rob had one too, and quite liked it (he just smiled real big), and
Adam, one of Lea's new coworkers (her boss?) ordered one after because it looked
good (but he's a self-proclaimed whisky-lover, so i'll have to try something
more whisky-y next time!).  Well-liked all around.  But this time when i brought
it out, i decided to garnish it with an orange peel -- an excellent choice, i
think!  (Lemon twist would have been too bright against the Fernet.. minty,
herbal, orange -- a great and well-balanced flavor combination...)
