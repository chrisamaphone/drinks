8-up (a non-alcoholic treat)

1 oz simple
1 oz lemon
1 oz lime
(optional: a dash of rhubarb bitters)

Shake hard over ice.  Pour into a ice-filled fizz glass.  Top with soda.

If the imbiber is okay with a touch of alcohol, the dash of rhubarb bitters
adds an extra layer of sweet/sour complexity to the drink.
