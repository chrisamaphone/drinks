St. Claire (made up by Brian)

2 oz Bastille whiskey
1/2 oz Dubonnet
1/2 oz St. Germaine
1 dash Peychaud's bitters?

Made up 03-03-2015 while Brian and i watched the Killing Game, an ST:V episode
that took place largely in a holodeck simulation set to St. Claire, France
during WWII.  More of a Manhattan.  For the other drink, mine, see the 14th
Arrondissement.
