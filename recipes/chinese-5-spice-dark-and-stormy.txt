Chinese 5-spice Dark and Stormy [from the Morgenthaler Method]

2 oz Chinese 5-spice rum
top with quality ginger beer (e.g., Fever Tree)

Garnish: lime squeeze


Chinese 5-spice rum

1 tsp Chinese 5-spice powder
750 mL Gosling's Black Seal rum

Combine, shake, leave for > 1 hour (up to overnight), then strain with a coffee
filter.  Yummy!  Spicy!  I used the Penzey's 5-spice powder, which is a little
less savory than i'd like, i think, on account of using dried ginger instead of
Szechuan peppercorns.  Maybe i can track down a different kind and try some
experiments...

Also, the recipe can be scaled.  I actually made just under 200 mL's worth,
using 1/4 tsp Chinese 5-spice powder.  Better for experimentation, since i
won't likely be going through an entire bottle of this at a time..
