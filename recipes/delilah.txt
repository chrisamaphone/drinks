Delilah

1-1/2 oz gin
3/4 oz lemon
3/4 oz Cointreau [Grand Marnier]

Lemon squeeze [lemon twist].

About as exciting as sipping ice water, as promised by Cocktail.  But the best
i could do with the liqueur and cordial selection at Middlefield Giant Eagle.
(Greater Burton has a great beer selection these days, but liquor is sorely
lacking.)  But it is the first thing i've made with gin that Tim liked!

In fact, i made it with 1/2 oz Grand Marnier instead of 3/4 oz Cointreau, since
i figured GM was sweeter and i didn't want it to overpower the drink.  Mom and
Tim drank the first batch, and then i stepped it up to the full 3/4 oz Grand
Marnier, which was noticeably sweeter and perhaps the better cocktail, though
Tim preferred the first way (surprisingly!).  The Grand Marnier does add an
odd cognac flavor that the Cointreau would not...
