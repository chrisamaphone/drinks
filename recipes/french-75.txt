French 75

.25 gin
.25 Cointreau
.25 lemon juice
4 (or so) sparkling wine

Garnish with a lemon twist.

The mixed part has a tendency to freeze, weirdly.. as with the French 77, mix
a bunch minus the champagne, pour into glasses, and then top with bubbly.  I
found the experience to be quite different at the bottom of the glass than at
the top.
