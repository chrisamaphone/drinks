Rum Old Fashioned (a womcave original, ish)

2 oz dark rum
1/4 oz falernum
1-2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stir, garnish with a lemon peel.

05-08-2013: Made this up as a hopefully-better-than-the-Arak alcohol-forward
dark rum drink.  And it was better.. a little bittersy maybe.. but definitely
drinkable and enjoyable.  It's sort of like a Corn and Oil, but dark rum
instead of blackstrap, and a little bit less falernum, and without the lime
juice accent, which i always thought seemed perfunctory anyway (but i'm known
to have difficulties with citrus-as-an-accent [CA3]).

I also flamed the lemon peel... *sheepish*

Although tasty, it was not something i'd count among my favorites.  Might a
better dark rum help?  (I used Black Seal, which is fine, but definitely on the
inexpensive side.. i don't really have any sippin' aged rums.)

Update, Wednesday, 02-05-2013: Yes, a better dark rum helps a *lot*!  So does
changing up the sweetener.  I tried both maple syrup and simple syrup, with my
lovely new Flor de Ca√±a 12 year c/o 8 via Nicaragua.  Both worked well -- the
simple syrup was more rum-forward, which was good to showcase the rum, but the
maple syrup blended better, making a more well-rounded, balanced cocktail.  This
one was totally delicious.. makes me think i should try making more Old
Fashioneds at home with other things..

Also... lemon peel?  ... Orange peel!  And it goes in the glass with the syrup
and bitters, gets stirred around a bit with the ice, before you add the spirits.
Like a proper Old Fashioned...
