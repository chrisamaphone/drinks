Blood and Sand

[Cocktail ratio]
1 oz scotch
1 oz orange juice
3/4 oz sweet vermouth
3/4 oz Cherry Heering

Garnish: flamed orange peel.

Wow, now this is a great drink!  I'm not usually the biggest fan of scotch,
especially not mixed, as it tends to take over a drink, but this is really
well balanced.  Maybe because of the orange juice, which also has a tendency
to take over a drink, but only to flatten it.  The two forces fight each other.
Smokey and sweet, a delectable treat!

Was well-loved by both Chris and Ben, as well.


02-15-2015: For whatever reason, i remembered thinking this drink was never
quite well-balanced in the way i wanted -- a memory belied by my words above!
-- so i set out to perfect it, with help from the palates of Brian, Tom, and
Rose.  Came up with this:

["Perfected" non-smoky-scotch ratio]
1-1/2 oz scotch
3/4 oz blood orange juice
1/2 oz sweet vermouth
1/2 oz Cherry Heering

I do think the sweet vermouth and Cherry Heering need to be in balance, because
otherwise one stands out too much over the other.  The extra orange juice over
both sweet parts adds a bit of fresh tartness, and the large measure of scotch
brings the dryness and strength up to expected levels for modern tastes.  Very
nicely balanced, and a real pleasure to imbibe!

All that said, i do think the original Cocktail ratio 4:4:3:3 works better with
a slightly smoky blend, like Black Grouse or Johnny Walker Black.  For the ratio
above and the experiments that zeroed in on it, i was using the non-smoky Famous
Grouse.  I suspect that 2:1:1:1 (Robert Hess's ratio) would also work well with
a smokier blend, but it was too sweet for most of our tastes with the Famous.

It was a fun exploration, and blood orange season comes but once a year -- blink
and you miss it!  Glad i caught it this time..
