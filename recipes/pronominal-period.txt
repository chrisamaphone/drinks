Pronominal Period (invented w/Tom 7 @ 1947 Miercocktails, 10-01-2014, deployed/trialed 10-04-2014)

3/4 oz strong gin (e.g., Bell Ringer 94.4 proof)
3/4 oz lemon juice
3/4 oz Cynar
3/4 oz Benedictine

Invented by the newly-named "double-entry bookkeeping" method for creating new
cocktails, first proposed in my analysis of the Cloister cocktail.  You break
a cocktail down into its component parts, change one thing, and then start
paying off debts and canceling credits.  E.g.:

The Last Word:
    gin: herbal, base
    lime: sour, bitter
    maraschino: sweet, funky
    Chartreuse: monastic, herbal, anesthetic

    -->

    Replace Chartreuse with Benedictine: monastic, herbal, sweet.
    Need to replace maraschino with something, since we have a sweet surplus --
    try Cynar, which is bitter and funky.
    Now we have too much bitter, so we replace lime with lemon.

    strong gin: herbal, base, anesthetic
    lemon: sour
    Cynar: bitter, funky
    Benedictine: monastic, herbal, sweet

All resources consumed and all debts paid off!

Tried it out at Lea's parents' party, 10-04-2014.  I think it's not quite as
good as a last word -- perhaps a little too bitter -- but the method works
surprisingly well!

The name is a little silly:

    Last: finality, temporality, adjectival
    Word: syntactic, linguistic, nominal

    Pronominal: linguistic, adjectival
    Period: syntactic, finality, temporality, nominal
