MesoClassiconi

1 gin (Plymouth)
1 Gran Classico Bitter
1 Punt e Mes

Garnish: orange peel.  (To do: try this with an orange wheel instead.)

Like a negroni, but with a sweeter than usual bitter and a bitterer than
usual sweet.  Comes out really bitter, actually!  I think it would do well
to have a few drops of orange juice from a half wheel.  Pretty tasty, but
extremely dry.  Slightly thick on the mouthfeel, too.
