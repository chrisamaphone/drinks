Chris made this for me for the first time as part of a consolation Sunday
brunch on August 5th, 2012 -- we got rained out of Pedal Pgh that day, and
came to my house with the intention of playing video games.  Wound up
drinking Ramoses and this with 8 and co.  Delicious creamy brunch cocktails!

I think i'd always passed this one over because it didn't have any citrus
in it, and what cocktail doesn't have citrus?  I forgot about things like
the Milk Punch which are completely and utterly delicious cream/milk drinks,
and this is no exception.  It's actually better balanced than a Milk Punch,
i think -- not too boozey, not too sharp.
