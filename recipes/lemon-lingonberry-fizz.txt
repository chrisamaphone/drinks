Lemon-Lingonberry Fizz

1 1/2 Lingonberry concentrate (from Ikea)
1 1/2 lemon juice
1 egg white

Dry shake, shake with ice, pour into a chilled fizz glass, and top with seltzer.
Garnish: lemon twist.

Made this up -- for the second time -- 10-23-2012, for Ben.  Had made it up
before for Chris, at the Barista Party 2.0 / 8 going-away party, because i
had Lea put it on the menu to make the Teetotal category have 3 items without
actually knowing what was in it.

Hope this makes sense!
