Blue Moon (*not* the Cocktail version!)

1-1/2 gin
3/4 lemon juice
1/2 Creme Yvette

Garnish: lemon twist.

Like an Aviation, but not.  It's interesting: you get both the sweetness and the
florality from the Creme Yvette instead of the sweetness from the maraschino and
the florality from the creme de violette.  It's a more sour drink, but entirely
palatable to me.  Kat's not as big of a fan.  Simplicity in construction, but
complexity from the ingredients themselves.
