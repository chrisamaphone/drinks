Boulevardier

1-1/2 oz bourbon
3/4 oz sweet vermouth
3/4 oz Campari

Kind of between a Manhattan and a Negroni.  Even Matt thought it tasted heavily
of Campari, and he likes his Campari.  But i think this ratio is lovely -- it
lets everything have its moment in the sun, its 15 minute on stages.  Both
smoother and drier than a Manhattan, with more body than a Negroni.

Q: What else is between a Manhattan and a Negroni?  i.e., gin, sweet vermouth,
and Angostura bitters?
