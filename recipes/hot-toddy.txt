Hot Toddy variations

1-1/2 bourbon
1/2 green chartreuse
1/2 lemon juice
3-4 oz hot water

garnish: lemon slice and star anise

Very herbal, not very sweet.  Maybe a little too on the dry side..

1-1/2 bourbon
1/2 lemon juice
barspoon honey
3-4 oz hot water

garnish: star anise

Mmmm, the sore throat just melted away.  Truly a pleasure to drink.

To try: strega and chai -- had something like this at Salt, and it was
*fantastic*!  The strega and chai herbs and spices complemented each other
perfectly.  Very warm, very soothing...

(Hot Bonnie, from Cocktail)
1-1/2 bourbon
1/4 oz lemon juice
barspoon honey
4 oz hot water

garnish: lemon squeeze

The lemon squeeze lets the imbiber adjust the acidity.  Lemon juice starts just
as an accent, though.

(Classic style, from Imbibe!)
2 oz brandy (or whiskey or gin or rum or whatever, but pot-stilled!  thick!)
3-4 oz hot water
1 tsp sugar

garnish: grated nutmeg

Dissolve the sugar in the hot water in the mug (should be about half full),
then add the booze.  Grate nutmeg over the top if you like.  Easy peasy, and
super tasty!  We used E&J XO (the good stuff.. $13!), and it worked really
well.  You can also use hot milk instead of hot water for a hot milk punch.

There's something to be said for these really simple pre-Prohibition cocktails.
This one doesn't even have bitters!  It predates the Cocktail proper.
