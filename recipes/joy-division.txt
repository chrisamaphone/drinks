Joy Division

2 oz gin
1 oz dry vermouth
1/2 oz Cointreau
3-4 dashes absinthe

Lemon twist.

Kind of a kicked up Martini variation.  A little like a more balanced, less
boozy Vesper.  The Cointreau really works wonders with the dry vermouth -- a
phenomenon i believe i've noted before, e.g., in the Satan's Whiskers: orange
plus dry vermouth comes together beautifully.  The absinthe just spanks it up
a notch -- i used half a capful of Herbsaint, what was available at Brian's.
Made it there Wed, 10-09-2014 for Tea and Trek -- i'd read about it earlier in
the day in an interview with one of the people who founded Death and Co, about
the part-instructional part-autobiography they just wrote about Death and Co.

For what it's worth, i used Waterloo gin and Dolin dry.  Both great choices.
Kind of a sweeter, Old-Tom-style base, with Dolin's nice smooth vanilla notes.
Quite a lovely drink, if on the strong side.  Kaplan said in the interview that
it "has a gorgeous color", which is true!  It was a very clean, pale blue, like
a huge body of clear water, a sort of swimming pool blue.  Absinthe plus dry
vermouth makes blue???  How does that work?  (Ouzo effect?)
