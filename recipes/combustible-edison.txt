Combustible Edison (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz brandy
3/4 oz lemon
3/4 oz Campari

Garnish: lemon twist.

Shake the lemon and the Campari over ice and strain into a chilled cocktail
glass prepared with garnish.  Heat the brandy to close to boiling (~20s in the
microwave does it pretty well), to get some of it into a gaseous state, then
dim the lights, set it on fire, and pour it into the chilled lemon/Campari.
Beautiful blue flames will wow the crowd!

You can make four at once using two shakers if you shake half the brandy:
1-1/2 oz each of brandy, lemon, and Campari goes into each of the shakers,
then 3 oz brandy total gets lit on fire and poured equally into the 4 glasses.

Made for Cinema Salon 2014-02-23 (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), because
hey, '90s band, i guess?  Also fire?

Earlier, featured as the solution to the puzzle game at the Truly Irate Science
Party Halloween 2012 (actually, iirc the answer was "TESLA", but that triggered
the preparation of a single Combustible Edison, whose secret formula was somehow
contained in the answer as well...?).

NB: Cocktail says 2 oz, 1 oz, 1 oz, but that's a big drink for my tastes.
