Apricot Crusta (my own cobbling-together)

1-1/2 oz brandy
1/4 oz lemon juice
1/4 oz maraschino liqueur
1/8 oz simple syrup (or a bit of granulated sugar)
half a small apricot
1 dash bitters

Muddle the apricot with the sugar/syrup, maraschino, and lemon juice.
(And bitters, i suppose -- i kept forgetting them.)  Add the brandy,
shake, and strain into a champagne flute.  Garnish with a long swath
of lemon peel inside the rim of the glass.  (Ideally it should be
sugar-encrusted, but i cheated.  Possibly a good way of making the
garnish would be to use the ice pick method to peel a lemon, but
instead of cutting longitudinally to remove the peel from the fruit,
cut in half along the equator -- each half makes a crusta-compatible
cup!)

Made 08-02-2013 for Kontroll viewing, as a loose homage to the fruit
brandies of Hungary, p√°linka.  I didn't actually try one though, as
i'm taking a teetotaler week.  Ends after Saturday -- maybe i'll try
one on Sunday?  (It got positive reviews from Trevor, Lizzie, and
Chris.  More positive from Lizzie and Chris, but they got the perfected
version..)

Update, 09-04-2013: works with prune plums, too -- maybe better!  (I finally
got around to trying it, but unfortunately, apricots are gone for the year now,
i think, so i had to improvise slightly..)  I quite like the whole deal -- a
sweet drink that's not sickly, lemon playing an accent role.. it's rather unlike
any other drink i've ever had in that it's neither particularly spirit-forward
nor particularly citrusy or sour.  Should play around a bit more with crustas!
Maybe even do the garnish "right" sometime..
