Aviation (Cocktail recipe)

1.5 gin
.75 lemon
.5 maraschino liqueur

I used Luxardo, smuggled in from Austin, TX liquor superstore SPEC's.  (You
can special order it in Pennsylvania, but currently only 3 bottles at a time.)
This is quite a sour drink, but the sour is well-balanced by the maraschino
without becoming overly sweet.  I think the 3:2 ratio of lemon to maraschino
is correct.


Aviation (Embury recipe)

2 gin
.75 lemon
.75 maraschino
.25 Creme Yvette

Creme Yvette is what they use at Embury in place of creme de violette, which
they used in the one at Péché in Austin -- i remember finding their's too
overly sweet, almost chocolatey creamy, a product i think of too much
maraschino liqueur.  This recipe falls prey to the same problem -- it's just
too sweet.  Also a bit big, maybe.


Aviation (custom recipe)

1.5 gin
.75 lemon
.5 maraschino liqueur
.25 Creme Yvette

Wanted to get at the floral/herbal combo that's supposed to come from Creme
Yvette and gin, and this mix succeeded better than the Embury recipe -- not
as too sweet, but still maybe a bit too sweet.  Next time, i'll try .25 each
of maraschino liqueur and Creme Yvette, but i worry that that might make it
too sour.  Might also want to experiment with more gin.  We'll see!  (Different
gin might also make a big impact.  Currently pouring New Amsterdam for its
unique price/performance ratio.)


[ Robert Hess (drinkboy) recommends this recipe:

  2 gin
  .5 lemon
  .5 maraschino liqueur
  .25 creme de violette

  Aside from the 2 oz gin instead of 1.5 oz gin, it just takes the Cocktail
  recipe and substitutes .25 oz creme de violette for .25 oz of the lemon juice.
  Skeptical!  But intrigued.  I guess it's important to understand the role that
  the violette is playing.  I'll have to try to draw that out in my other
  experiments. ]


Aviation (*my* recipe!  most recent.)

1.5 gin
.75 lemon
.25 maraschino liqueur
.25 Creme Yvette

Yay!  Perfect!  Ly balanced.  Even Chris liked it!

03-09-2011: Made with Creme de Violette.  Even better!  Blue, and more floral.

Aviation #6

1.5 gin
.75 lemon
.5 maraschino liqueur
.25 Creme de Violete

Back to #3 (the "custom"), with C. de Vio. instead of C. Yv.  Since the Vio is
not as sweet, you need to bump back up the maraschino.
