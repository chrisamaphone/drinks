Death in the Afternoon

1-1/2 oz absinthe
4 oz champagne

In the words of Papa Hemingway: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne
glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness.
Drink three to five of these slowly."

I don't think i could handle three to five :P  One was pretty hefty!  The
Absente was probably the best -- the Vieux Carre was an unsatisfying brown
color and heavily herbal, not balanced enough -- and Grande Absente the
worst -- didn't become milky enough, too strong, not great flavor...

One of these will do one in.  Maybe dial it down to 1 oz absinthe for a more
accessible drink?
