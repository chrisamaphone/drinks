Cloister (had at Livermore, recipe from the Cocktail Spirit)

1-1/2 oz gin
1/2 oz grapefruit
1/2 oz yellow chartreuse
1/4 oz lemon
[1/4 oz simple]

Garnish with a grapefruit twist or lemon twist.

I made this for myself at home, when Michelle Markle was visiting, and it
didn't *quite* hit the spot.. too sweet, hence my optionalizing the 1/4 simple,
which i think is really for mouthfeel more than sweetness.  Later analyzed it
as having the Pegu nature on account of the ratios from Robert Hess's video.
Here's the expert-systems-style breakdown:

    Pegu:               Cloister:
    -----               ---------
    gin = base          gin = base
    lime = citrus       grapefruit = citrus
           sour                      sweet
           juice                     juice
    Cointreau = citrus  Yellow Chartreuse = herbal
                sweet                       sweet
    bitters = herbal    lemon = sour

See, it all kinda balances out!  Replace the Cointreau with another sweet
liqueur, like Yellow Chartreuse.. what have you done?  Taken away some citrus
flavor, but added an herbaceous kick.  So maybe as an accent, we use a splash
of lemon instead of bitters, since what we need is more citrus.  But orange
isn't quite lemon, so maybe for the main juice, we'll use grapefruit, which
is also sweeter than lime, good because the Cointreau was probably sweeter
than the Yellow Chartreuse.  All kinda balances out, like i said..

I wonder if you could actually learn and derive from this kind of breakdown
idea, rather than just analyze.
