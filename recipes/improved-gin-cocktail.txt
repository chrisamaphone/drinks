Improved Gin Cocktail (via David Wondrich)

1-1/2 to 2 oz gin (we tried 1-1/2, but 2 might be more "standard")
1/2 to 1 tsp 2:1 simple (we tried 1 tsp, and it was a little sweet)
1 tsp Cointreau or Maraschino (i tried Cointreau)
2 dashes bitters

Spritz and garnish with an orange peel.  (Wondrich calls for lemon, but we had
oranges, and i thought it'd work quite nicely, which it did!  Maybe lemon if the
liqueur were Maraschino..)

Chris made these at the Doshery 2014-04-04 after dinner.  Sweet, but pleasant.
Another nice reminder than gin exists -- winter is finally almost gone, and
anyway, lots of old whiskey favorites like the Old Fashioned (aka the Cocktail)
or the Hot Toddy can actually be made quite tastily with gin.  Would try either
1/2 tsp simple instead of 1 for a less syrupy feel, or upping the gin to 2 oz
for a stronger, fuller cocktail (though i worry it might get overpowered by
juniper).
