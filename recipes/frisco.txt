Frisco (from Cocktail)

2 oz rye
3/4 oz lemon
1/4 oz Benedictine

Garnish: lemon wheel.

02-11-2013: This was the cocktail of the week about this time two years ago,
during Week 8.  I was so unenthused with it i never wrote an entry for it..

I think this is unbalanced in its current recipe, but while originally i thought
it was too much rye, now that i've had some strong, rye-heavy cocktails that i
really like (like the Sazerac), in retrospect, i think the problem is that it's
too lemony, with nothing to balance the lemon.  A thought i might once have had
on how to rebalance it would be to go with a classic 1-1/2:3/4:1/4 ratio, but
now i think that would just emphasize the lemon further, resulting in a still-
unbalanced drink.  Maybe instead treat it like an Embury-style 1:2:8 sour-type
cocktail and drop the lemon down to 1/2 oz?  That's my current theory.
