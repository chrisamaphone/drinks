Molly Picon

1 gin
1 sweet vermouth
1 Amer Picon

Garnish: lemon twist

We made it using Beefeater gin and Bittermen's Amere Nouvelle for the Amer
Picon.  Negroni inspiration and roots give way to orange complexity.  More
herbal than i would have guessed -- the orange in the amer really plays well
on the orange in the sweet vermouth.  Neither so in-your-face nor so boringly
as a negroni.
