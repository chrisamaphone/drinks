Inspiration [Parsley drink]

1-1/2 oz gin
3/4 oz lemon
3/8 oz simple
1 dash celery bitters
leaves from 1-2 sprigs parsley

Shake all ingredients well.  Serve in a chilled champagne glass, top with
seltzer, and garnish with a lemon peel and a fresh sprig of parsley.  Makes
a wonderfully refreshing aperitif.

Quasi-invented Wed, 04-10-2013, over dinner @ home w/Chris and Kat (leftover
hearty bean stew).  Inspired by Abe's cocktail when Chris and i went to his
and Ann's for dinner a week or two ago, hence the name.
