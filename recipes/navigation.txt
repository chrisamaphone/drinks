1-1/2 oz light rum
3/4 oz lemon juice
1/4 oz Cointreau
1/4 oz grenadine

Aviation-esque sour, but more tropical and nautical, made up for Tim 12-27-2014
at home in Burton.  nicely balanced, i thought!  Might also be nice with gin --
half and half, to maintain a bit of tropical/tiki-ness to it?  But i think the
overall balance of base to sour to sweet worked nicely -- tasted both sweet and
sour all at once.
