Alternate recipe, 02-20-2013, via The Straight Up
(http://drinkstraightup.com/2013/02/11/fernet-branca/)

2 oz rye
1/4 oz simple (recipe says 2 dashes)
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca
2 dashes Angostura

Garnish: orange peel

Sweeter, but more herbaceous with the extra dash of Angostura.  Kind of a
warmer, sharper version of the same.  Reminds me of a Sazerac, with the
Fernet playing the role of the harshing agent.

Going to Toronto tomorrow, so i had to try this :)
