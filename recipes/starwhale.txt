(Orange) Starwhale (c/o Dom, Trevor, and the Treehouse crew)

1-1/2 gin (Tanq 10 works well)
1/2 orange juice
1/2 Domaine de Canton

Shake over ice, pour into a highball glass filled with ice cubes,
top with seltzer.  Garnish with an orange wheel.

Made by nostalgic request at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012.  Original
recipe: "gin, ginger, ginger ale, and orange juice".

Wasn't super orangey, but very refreshing.  Rather ginny with Tanq 10 --
but that's not a bad thing.

Variations to try:
    - up the OJ to 3/4 oz to round it out a bit more.
    - muddle fresh ginger in the mixing tin for more ginger flavor
