Lemon Soapbubble (made up 2014-02-01 for Manya)

1-1/2 oz gin (Hayman's Old Tom)
3/4 oz St. Germain
1/4 oz lemon
1/4 oz lime
1/4 oz Yellow Chartreuse

Lemon peel garnish

Made this up at Brian's dance party on Monya's specification: something sweet,
with that stuff she really liked last time that was sweet and delicious.  Took
a moment of sleuthing, but it became apparent that the liqueur in mind here was
St. Germain -- of course!  Made three, and gave one to Manya, half of one to
Haixin, and shared half of one with various people for reactions.

Lizzie said it tasted like lemon boiled sugar candy, i.e., like a lemon drop.
I think the lemon oils contributed to that essence.  Manya and Haixin both
liked it a lot, and in particular, Manya thought it tasted like a soap bubble
-- but in a good way!  She named it.  Chris also enjoyed it, and thought to
call it a Dali, because she was looking at a Dali poster, but i said it's not
nearly absurdist enough to be called a Dali.

My thinking here was to invert my usual sour-type ratio, with more sweet than
sour, and to split the sour between lemon and lime because i thought lime would
play up the grapefruit notes of the St. Germain (and also because that's the
Cocktail trick for margaritas!).  The Chartreuse was to be a complexifier, but
it didn't add as much complexity as i'd have liked.  Peychaud's could have been
interesting, and maybe hum for its floral qualities.  Next time!
