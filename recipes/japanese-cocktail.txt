Japanese Cocktail (from the Cocktail Spirit with Robert Hess)

2 oz brandy (Pierre Ferrand Ambre cognac)
1/2 oz orgeat
2 dashes Angostura

The Angostura was a bit much -- maybe smaller dashes, or just 1 next time.
Also, perhaps i'd try a mellower, less fruit-forward brandy, like the E&J XO.
I think that might blend nicer with the orgeat.  Would be nice if the orgeat
had a more assertive flavor, too, though i'm not yet sure how to accomplish
that.

07-10-2014: Tried again at the Core, with Chris executing.  E&J VS vs. E&J XO.
Thoughts: (1) i think her dasher was less excited than mine, so less Angostura,
and more balance, (2) regular brandy works great here, maybe better than the
fruity Pierre Ferrand cognac, and (3) the VS and the XO were markedly different,
with most (Chris, Tom) preferring the XO's richness alongside the orgeat.  I'm
inclined to agree, but thought the VS's fruitiness made an interesting cocktail
as well, emphasizing the orange flower and benzaldehyde notes.  Somehow the VS
version wound up tasting a little like banana...!  Who let those esters in?
Maybe E&J...

Would like to try with a drier, less intensely flavored cognac maybe.  Perhaps
the Landy VS would work well?
