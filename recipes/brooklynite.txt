04-15-2013: Quite nice!  I like this rum kick that i'm on -- i'm learning that
rum cocktails can be every bit as complex and interesting as gin cocktails, not
just fruity tiki drinks.  Though the citrus is certainly way important..

I like how Angostura and dark rum kind of makes spiced rum without all the
artifice.

What a weird ratio, though -- a barspoon is a teaspoon is a third of a
tablespoon, which is half of an ounce, so 1:6:12.  Maybe Embury would approve?

Next up i think maybe a gin/rum cocktail.. there are a few..
