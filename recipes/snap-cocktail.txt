Snap cocktail (made as a challenge 2014-01-17 at Lizzie's birthday party)

1 oz Snap liqueur
1/2 oz bourbon
3/4 oz lime juice
1/4-1/2 oz honey/simple
2 dashes Angostura

A little sweeter than i'd like, but pretty much like a Blackstrap Sour using
completely different base ingredient(s) and sweeteners.  Well-liked by all,
and a pleasant surprise -- everybody kinda thought the Snap was shit.

The recipe i actually made was closer to 3/4 Snap, 3/4 bourbon, but i added a
bit more Snap after tasting.  I think 1, 1/2 would be fine.  Another idea:
swap out the bourbon for light rum -- bring out the molasses elements in the
Snap!  (Mostly the game here was to try to play up the interesting bits of the
Snap and not have it take over as the 80 proof behemoth that it is.. balance and
accent..)
