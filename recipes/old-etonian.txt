Old Etonian (legume-style)

1-1/2 oz gin (i used Beefeater... Martin Miller's would probably be good, too)
1-1/2 oz Dolin Blanc
1 oz lemon juice
1/4 oz Pisa nut liqueur

Serve over ice in a rocks glass.  Garnish with a lemon peel.

Quite a sour drink.  Maybe a bit heavy on the lemon juice..

The Dolin Blanc has a bit of a nutty flavor to begin with, which i think is
accentuated by the nut liqueur.  Would like to try it with amaretto (as it was
at legume), and perhaps with 1/2 oz sweetener instead of 1/4 oz.  Alternatively
less lemon juice.

Online recipes call for Kina Lillet (or Lillet Blanc), Creme de Noyaux instead
of the nut liqueur, and a couple dashes of orange bitters in lieu of the lemon.
Worth trying some variations, huh.  And actually, tasting Lillet Blanc side by
side with Dolin Blanc.

[Sunday, 03-04-2012] Tried it with 1/2 oz Pisa, and it worked pretty well!
Actually it worked terribly, but then i realized i was using Dolin Dry instead
of Dolin Blanc.  Then i made a second one, and it was great.
