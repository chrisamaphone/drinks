Red Velvet (invented by Ben, named by my flavor insight)

2 oz blackstrap rum
1 oz beet shrub (see taming*.txt for recipe)
1/2 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz falernum

Tastes like beet chocolate cake!  The blackstrap takes center stage,
but it couldn't get where it is today without the supporting cast of
beet, encouraged by lemon, and the spiciness of the falernum to tie
it all together.  Another "accented by lemon" cocktail.
