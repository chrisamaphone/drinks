Drink That Tastes Like Fall (made up for Chris 2013-10-09)

1-1/2 applejack
1/2 sherry
1/4 pumpkin spice syrup (or 1/2, but then too sweet)
1/4 lime juice
dash Angostura

Garnish: green apple slice.

Wound up trying to combine too many Fall-like things: spices, apples, pumpkins,
woodiness.  I think probably apple *or* pumpkin would have worked better.. not
quite sure what the base would be if not applejack, though, and the lime juice
in this quantity didn't turn applejack into granny smith like it does in an
applejack sour..
