Last Word

1 gin
1 Maraschino Liqueur
1 Green Chartreuse
1 lime juice

Whoa fuck, maraschino!  I think this shit needs the Tub gin to smack down the
maraschino liqueuer, and draw out the herbal notes of the green chartreuse.
How the hell does green chartreuse get overrun in a cocktail?  (8 says that
maraschino liqueur is one of the most detectable ingredients we have -- right
up there with Pernod.)

04-01-2011: Tub made it a bit better, but it's still a very powerful (and
expensive!) drink.  I think it works in some contexts, but i'm happy to
relegate it to the top shelves, rarely to be accessed..

06-25-2011: Actually, quite good with Hendrick's, which accentuates the herbal
qualities of the Chartreuse without overwhelming the maraschino liqueur.  Better
balanced than any Last Word i've had before.  The Tub was too forward, i think,
which makes for more competition than this drink wants.

08-20something-2011: substitute Suze for Maraschino and you have the First Word,
an *amazing* aperitif with a brilliant melding of herbaceousity and limeitude.
Extremely tasty, especially with an herbal gin -- Hendrick's would work great,
and Citadelle does as well, for practically half the price!

    First Word

    1 gin
    1 Suze
    1 Green Chartreuse
    1 lime juice


11-19-2011: Substitute Angostura bitters for the gin and you have the Bitter
Word -- yes, i'm serious (two sources!), and it is *delicious*.  Highly clovey,
lovely blood-red color, not too sweet, not too herbal.  Surprisingly balanced!

    Bitter Word

    1 Angostura
    1 maraschino liqueur
    1 Green Chartreuse
    1 lime juice


11-21-2011: And for a more aperitify alternative, substitute Bittermen's
Amere Sauvage for the Suze in a First Word -- we call it a Zeroth Word.
(Sauvage has a more tea-like herbal character, less sweet, hence "more
aperitify".  I like it in a Zeroth Word, and it's interesting in and of
itself, but it's no Suze...)

    Zeroth Word (or Savage Word)

    1 gin (Citadelle or other herbal)
    1 Bittermen's Am√®re Sauvage
    1 Green Chartreuse
    1 lime juice
