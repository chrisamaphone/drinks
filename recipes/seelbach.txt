Seelbach (from Bitters)

1 bourbon
1/2 Cointreau
7 dashes Angostura
7 dashes Peychaud's
top with chilled dry sparkling wine (e.g., Prosecco)

Garnish: orange peel.

Holy bitters, Batman!  Super red, and super herbal, without that sweetness that
rides along with something like Chartreuse.  Almost like just bitters and soda,
but prosecco instead.  This was a fun one, but definitely for the long haul --
a real sipper.
