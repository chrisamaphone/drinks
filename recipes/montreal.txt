Montreal (from Brother Cleve on Twitter)

2 rye ("Canadian whisky)
3/4 St. Germain
1/2 Fernet Branca
good dash of maple bitters

Garnish: orange peel

Toronto on sponsors!  I didn't have maple bitters 05-26-2012 when i made this,
so i used Black Walnut bitters instead.  Ryan, who initially asked only for
"sweeter whisky drinks" and "a rum and coke" (made him a Black Strap Sour
instead :P  loved it!) actually liked this one.  Pretty complex.  The St.
Germain doesn't stand out a lot...
