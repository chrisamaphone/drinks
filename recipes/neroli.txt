Neroli (from http://www.thedailymeal.com/video/related/686)

1-1/2 oz Solerno
1 oz orange juice (fresh squeezed)
1/2 oz Aperol
top with Prosecco (~1-1/2 oz).

Serve in a wine glass filled with ice.  Garnish with an orange wheel.

Neroli is the blossom from the bitter orange tree, while mimosa is the blossom
from the sweet orange tree, says the bartender in the video.  I was skeptical
of a cocktail using Solerno as a base, but it works!  It's both alcoholic enough
and complex enough, and it's the main flavor in this drink.  Aperol adds some
color and some complexity.  I think it could probably do with a dash of orange
bitters to complete the orange quadfecta.
