Succubus (invented Tuesday, Aug 21, 2012 with Chris)

2 oz Angel's Envy bourbon
1/2 oz Rammazzotti
1/4 oz Solerno

Garnish: orange peel.

Devilishly delicious, according to @solernoliqueur, who retweeted it :D
Pretty strong drink, though -- be careful.  It's basically straight bourbon,
and Angel's Envy is a strong bourbon, but the orange notes in both the amaro
and the Solerno add quite a bit of complexity to the strong vanilla nose of
the Angel's Envy.
