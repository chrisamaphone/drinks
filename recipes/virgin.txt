Virgin Cocktail #1
(note from Chris, 9/5/2015: for my defense party i’m naming this a “mint tulip”)

3 strawberries
1 lime's worth of lime juice
8-10 mint leaves
tonic water to taste

Invented for Lea 03-13-2010.

Muddle the strawberries and mint leaves in the lime juice and a splash of
tonic.  Once well-muddled, strain the liquid into a rocks glass over ice,
top off with tonic water, and stir.  The tonic water adds just enough
sweetness to counter the tart/sour of the strawberries/lime, and the mint
adds a hint of je ne sais quoi.  Originally served with a sprig of mint as
garnish, but Lea didn't like it.
