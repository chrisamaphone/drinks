Planter's (from Cocktail)
[not to be confused with Planter's Punch, similar, but different]

2 oz dark rum
1 oz orange juice
1/2 oz lemon juice
1 dash grenadine

Garnish: lemon twist.

Refreshing, yet boozy.  Sweet, yet sour.  Lemon, yet flaming.  (I can't help
myself!).

05-06-2013: A continuation of the rum study.  I was looking for a cocktail
that had a healthy dose of orange juice, to use up an orange half that i had
in the fridge, but it's hard to come by such things -- i imagine they're hard
to balance.  This one strikes it perfect, though -- it definitely tastes like
a rum cocktail, and the vanilla notes from the aged rum meld nicely with the
grenadine (my house-made 2.0), while the sweetness of the orange is tempered
by the tart lemon.  Flaming the peel probably helped bring out that vanilla
flavor, giving a touch of caramel to the drink -- but even if not, it's too
fun not to do :)

I gave a bit of a heavy-handed dash on the grenadine, because i've found that
my house-made grenadine lends a bit less flavor than recipes expect it to.
About 1/4 oz, probably.  I think it was just the right amount -- a hint of
color and a smoothly blended flavor.

07-19-2014: Made a couple more today: one for Lyndsey Moulds, using Gosling's
Black Seal rum, which was pretty easy drinking and probably pretty close to
what i remembered, and the other for myself, using Smith and Cross Navy Strength
Jamaican rum, which was soooo totally different and not as tasty.  Very complex.
Very funky.  Very boozy.  Lea says Smith and Cross smells like ozone.
