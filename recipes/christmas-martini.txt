Christmas Martini

2 oz gin
1/2 oz Rumple Minze peppermint schnapps
dash or two Angostura bitters

Intensely minty, but with a nice herbal rounding.  I used Tanqueray for maximal
juniper flavor, which i think tastes like Christmas.  The bitters adds a touch
of cloves and other Christmas spices.

Also *very* high alcohol content.  Careful with this one -- just one, and just
before dinner!
