Beret Franca

1.5 Cynar
.75 Dubonnet
.25 Fernet-Branca

a touch (.75?) of soda

Garnish orange wheel.

Like an Americano maison (French-style, with very little soda), but different
takes on all ingredients.  The Fernet is important to make it not too sweet --
both Cynar and Dubonnet are sweeter than their counterparts (Campari and
Cinzano).  Maybe try a dash of Angostura instead, and call it a Francese
(the Italian word for French).
