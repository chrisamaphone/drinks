Bamboo (from the Cocktail Spirit with Robert Hess)

1-1/2 oz sherry (he used amontillado, i used oloroso.. (what's the difference?))
1-1/2 oz dry vermouth
1 dash aromatic bitters
1 dash orange bitters

Garnish: orange peel.

Delicious!  Made for Chris at 09-04-2013 intimate aperos.  When i saw it on
YouTube, i knew this drink had her name on it.  Wonderful, ever-changing flavor:
starts out citrusy and aromatic, with the orange oils and the dry vermouth
botanicals, then it fades through a kind of sweetness to the rich butteriness
characteristic of sherry.  I told Rob this was a drink to imagine drinking in
the library, wearing his tweed jacket.

Much better balanced than the Arak, the last drink i made with an ounce and a
half of sherry.  (The oaky richness of the sherry being balanced there by only
the woody darkness of the dark rum.. who ever thought that would work? :P)
