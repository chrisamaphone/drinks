Irish Negroni (inspired by Embury)

1 Irish Whisky (Bushmill's)
1 sweet vermouth (Dubonnet!)
1 Cynar

Garnish with an orange peel.

Definitely riffing on a negroni here, obviously.  Got this one from Embury,
more or less -- the last drink i had them make up for me (or perhaps second
to last?): i asked for "something with Dubonnet".  I gathered that they usually
make it with some other sweet vermouth, probably Dolin, and i think he mentioned
Campari by name, but Campari and Irish Whisky fight too hard, i found -- Cynar
is precisely softer enough that it melds nicely.  Similarly for the Dubonnet --
our Cinzano is a bit too acidic and bright to complement the smooth whisky/
Cynar base, but Dubonnet provides a perfect well-roundedness.  Properly mixed,
no ingredient stands out, but they all contribute!

worked -- someone (Car?  Matt?) said it was too sweet?  (Probably Matt.)
