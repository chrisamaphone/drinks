Virgin Sacrifice (original, for Lea)

1-1/2 oz lemon juice
1 oz grenadine
top with soda, serve over ice in a fizz glass.  Lemon twist or wheel.

Invented for Lea at the Truly Irate Science Halloween Party 2012.

Can also be made alcoholic:


Slut Sacrificee

2 oz gin
1-1/2 oz lemon juice
3/4 oz grenadine
(optional) egg white

Invented for Chris and Eric (co-worker of David's) at informal Trevor-based
cocktails 12-03-2012.  The ratios are a little bit wonky, but i was trying to
preserve the tartness and flavor from Lea's drink, as requested by Chris.
Would probably work well as a standard 4-2-1 fizz.  Though the grenadine is
always a little less sweet, the way i make it, since it's not a 2:1.
