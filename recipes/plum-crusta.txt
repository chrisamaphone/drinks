Plum Crusta (a womcave original)

2 oz plum brandy
1/4 oz Creme Yvette
1/4 oz rich simple syrup
1/4 oz lemon juice

Serve in sugar lined champagne flutes with a long, wide lemon peel tucked into
the mouth.  (I found that my Y-peeler is great at making these: just spin the
lemon, while holding the peeler stationary -- not unlike the usual advice for
opening a bottle of champagne.)

Made up 2014-03-16 for Cinema Salon's showing of the Grandmaster, a Wonk Kar
Wai movie about acclaimed martial arts teacher Ip Man, who trained Bruce Lee.
Plum gives it an Asian influence, the Creme Yvette helps sweeten and color it,
and the simple gives it a nice mouthfeel.  The color is a beautiful pale red-
magenta, tending towards a washed out burgundy almost.  The flavor was a little
more plum-brandy-heavy than i wanted, but i should have learned by now what to
expect from this crusta recipe: it's like the old fashioned of brandies :)

To try: upping the Creme Yvette to a half oz, plus maybe (but probably not)
dropping the simple?, and perhaps lowering the brandy to 1-1/2.  My favorite
sidecar ratio is probably around 1-1/2:1/2:1/2, 3:1:1, but i think there's
another interesting drink to be had in between, where the lemon is still an
accent rather than a bonafide modifier, and the predominant flavor is still
brandy, but it's more balanced by floral notes.

I note that my Apricot Crusta recipe from a previous Cinema Salon actually
had only a 1-1/2 oz pour of brandy -- maybe that'd work better as a default
starting ratio.
