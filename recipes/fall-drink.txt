A Fall Drink (from Salt, Autumn 2013)

1-1/2 oz blended scotch (Chivas Regal)
1-1/2 oz "cider" (not sure if they mean normal cider or hard.. guessing normal)
1/2 oz Sorel liquor (liqueur?  sorrel?  not familiar with this product..)
1/4 oz Yellow Chartreuse

Serve in a Laphroaig-rinsed glass.  Garnish with lemon zest.  Tastes like fall!

There are some open questions in the recipe they wrote down for me, but i think
i could figure them out.  I'm betting Sorel is this Jack From Brooklyn stuff,
http://jackfrombrooklyn.com/recipe-products/sorel/, which i believe PA stores
recently started carrying (2014-06-28).  Digitizing this recipe to get it off
my fridge.
