Cyn-Cin (Negroni variation)

1 oz gin
1 oz Cinzano sweet vermouth
1 oz Cynar artichoke liqueur

Garnish with an orange wheel dropped into the drink, for sweetening effect.

Very much like a negroni, but very much better!  The Cynar offers the same
bitter, herbal notes as the Campari, but with a more naturalistic vibe -- no
artificial colors, no harsh, smoky aftertaste -- while the Cinzano sweetens
without deadening -- it's dry enough to create a kind of bitterness field
around the tongue.  Somehow, this drink winds up being both bitter and sweet
at the same time -- sweet, but not cloying; bitter, but not harsh.  It's truly
wonderful, and truly Italian!  Never drink a negroni again..
