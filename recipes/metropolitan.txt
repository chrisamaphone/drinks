A gin-based twist on the classic Cosmo.

1.5 gin
.5 cranberry juice (sweetened?)
.5 lime juice

My initial guess at ratios.  Rationale: cranberry packs a punch, especially
if it's already sweetened -- don't want too much.  But don't want the lime
to take center stage, either.  Not enough sweet though?

Pretty good actually.. but "missing something"


Variation 2 (Pegu?-esque):

1.5 gin
.75 cranberry juice
.25 lime juice
.25 Cointreau

More cran-heavy, but also with a bit of Cointreau in case the cranberry's not
sweet enough.  Just a touch, though, for accent!  Also reduces the lime juice
to an accent as well, since really, this is a cranberry drink.

Too Cointreauy, surprisingly!


Proposed alternative 3 (Aviation-esque):

1.5 gin
.75 cranberry juice
.5 lime juice
.25 Cointreau

I think this would have the "body" that Variation 2 above has (on account of
the extra cranberry juice), but with enough lime juice to counteract the
Cointreau-induced flavor imbalance.  And yet, i think the lime and cranberry
juice would not compete so much as they did in the initial guess, due to the
altered ratio.  Worry: not cranberry-y enough anymore?  We'll see...
