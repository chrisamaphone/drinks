One new cocktail per week.
    Strict variant: "new" meaning i've never made it before
    Relaxed variant: "new" meaning it's not on the list yet

In either case, the goal should be to have a solid list of 52 good cocktails
by the end of the year.

Week 1 (Jan 1-7): Pink Gin
    Notes: Made at Matt's after New Year's Eve.  Simple, yet complex!
Week 2 (Jan 8-14): Negroni
    An old standby that i'd never made.  Perfect bitter Italian aperitif.
Week 3 (Jan 15-21): Jasmine
    Delicious precursor to the Death's Comeback!  Sourer and better balanced.
Week 4 (Jan 22-28): One Spot
    Holy shit is this complex -- taste complexity 5! -- herbs^10000
Week 5 (Jan 29-Feb 4): Hemingway Daiquiri
    Tough to fully mix, with the maraschino's viscosity.  Less cloying than a regular daiquiri.
    [later: oh man, soooo much better with Mount Gay rum!  gulpable!]
Week 6 (Feb 5-Feb 11): Aviation
    I really like the Cocktail recipe -- sour, bright, and bitey!  Must experiment with variations involving Creme Yvette, as at Embury
Week 7 (Feb 12-Feb 18): Sidecar
    Didn't actually experiment much with this -- depression due to broken glasses
Week 8 (Feb 19-Feb 25): Frisco
    Made just an hour after the first Sidecar.. not super memorable..
Week 9 (Feb 26-Mar 4): Fernet Negroni
    Crazy twist on something!  Very powerful.. the Fernet is a little overpowering
Week 10 (Mar 5-Mar 11): Sazerac
    Played with some sweetnees variations.  Really delicious flavor combos..
Week 11 (Mar 12-Mar 18): Drink Without a Name
    Heavy, mostly because of the vodka.  A couple of these did me in...
Week 12 (Mar 19-Mar 25): Bitter
    A delicious herbal concoction of monastic proportions!
Week 13 (Mar 26-Apr 1): The Last Word
    Too much Maraschino, probably -- expensive and hard to parse.
Week 14 (Apr 2-Apr 8): Cyn-Cin
    Like the Negroni, minus all the bad, plus new good.  Why drink a Negroni ever again?
Week 15 (Apr 9-Apr 15): Rob Roy
    A bad Manhattan, when made with J&B.  A good scotch when made with Dalmore.
Week 16 (Apr 16-Apr 22): Foxtrot
    Like a Daiquiri with booze instead of sugar -- Cointreau/simple.  Also possible with lemon juice, in which case it's a "usual" with rum instead of gin!
Week 17 (Apr 23-Apr 29): Edisonian
    A bitterized Sidecar.  Tasty, but unbalanced, in my opinion.
Week 18 (Apr 30-May 6): Margarita
    Pretty tasty, with the right tequila.  I used El Tesoro de Don Felipe.
Week 19 (May 7-May 13): Applejack Sour
    Sour green apple in a drink!  Beautiful demonstration af applejack's potential.
Week 20 (May 14-May 20): Rusty Nail (delayed a bit -- backloaded)
    Not my favorite, especially with J&B, but the Drambuie helps a lot.
Week 21 (May 21-May 27): Sensation
    Amazing!  Minty, refreshing, and not overpowered by the maraschino liqueur.
Week 22 (May 28-Jun 3): Corpse Reviver
    Too cognacy, too woody.  Applejack not focused enough.  Calvados better?
Week 23 (Jun 4-Jun 10): Blue Boy
    Mmm... spicy!  Orange juice!  Dark rum!  Captivating.
Week 24 (Jun 11-Jun 17): Queen Elizabeth
    A bit much with the Pernod, imho.  Idea: Liz 10, using Tanq 10 and Herbsaint
Week 25 (Jun 18-Jun 24): Chartreuse
    A surprising and delightful cocktail!  All ingredients combine to form something new.
Week 26 (Jun 25-Jul 1): Atlas
    More complex than expected, and more alcoholic.  The lemon squeeze.. is key.
Week 27 (Jul 2-Jul 8, frontloaded due to Eurotrip): Comparatif
    The perfect aperitif, brought home by 8 from Portland, slightly modified to use available ingredients (Campari instead of Bonal Gentiane Quina).  The garnish is delicious once you decide it is food...
Week 28 (Jul 9-Jul 15, backdated due to Eurotrip): Amaroni
    Digestif made from aperitifs!  Nutty and warming.
Week 29 (Jul 16-Jul 22): Savoy Hotel Special
    Too sickly sweet, at least with Rose's grenadine.  Really need some good grenadine.  Also, the Savoy might be better, but need some Dubonnet for that.
Week 30 (Jul 23-Jul 29): Bronx River
    Wow, mmm!  Dry!  The sweet vermouth makes it just aperitify, and the rest makes it just balanced.  Strong one, though!
Week 31 (Jul 30-Aug 5): Creole #2
    Fantastic.  Like a Sazerac, but more herbal.  I like this cura√ßao!  Complexity 5 is well-deserved, and this drink inspired us to play with Pernod a bit.
Week 32 (Aug 6-Aug 12): First Word
    8 loves this drink -- the lime juice is so wonderful.
Week 33 (Aug 13-Aug 19): Irish Negroni
    Perfected after Embury recipe -- the keys are Cynar and Dubonnet, perfectly balanced
Week 34 (Aug 20-Aug 26): Mojito
    Lovely, but needs a *lot* of mint.  High mixing complexity, and i'd never made one before, but Chris wanted one with tacos, so..!
Week 35 (Aug 27-Sep 2): Astoria
    Strong and martini-like.  Not terribly impressive, even with an herbal gin.  Maybe a better gin would make it better.  The orange bitters didn't do much..
Week 36 (Sep 3-Sep 9): Aperchoke
    Terrible name by me.  This recipe came from Portland via 8.  Kate made it?
Week 37 (Sep 10-Sep 16): Blue Basil Martini
    Brilliant!  Tastes first like basil, then last like grapefruit, and somewhere in between, there's a bit of gin...?
Week 38 (Sep 17-Sep 23): Amber Spyglass
    Yes!  The cardamom worked!  Named by Chris.  (with orange peel instead: the Golden Compass; with both: the Subtle Knife)
Week 39 (Sep 24-Sep 30): Necessity
    ... the mother of invention.  What happens when you [St. Germain/Maraschino] Aviation.
Week 40 (Oct 1-Oct 7): Beret Franca
    Maybe too fernetty still.. but not bad.  Americano Maison twist.
Week 41 (Oct 8-Oct 14): Corpse Reviver #2
    A delicious gin cocktail with an herbal kick!  Ratios worth experimenting with..
Week 42 (Oct 15-Oct 21): Metropolitan
    Our gin-based Cosmo reboot.  Surprisingly fun to play with!  Not yet perfected.
Week 43 (Oct 22-Oct 28): Green-Eyed Monster
    My new favorite complexity 5.  Probably better with [absinthe/Pernod].
Week 44 (Oct 29-Nov 4): Fancy-Free
    Smells like beer, tastes delicious.  Orange bitters plays well with Angostura.
Week 45 (Nov 5-Nov 11): Bonita Applebum
    Thanks, @FernetBranca!  Surprisingly sweet -- guess that's the Drambuie.  Not too Fernet-y, amazingly.
Week 46 (Nov 12-Nov 18, a touch late): Brooklyn
    Maybe would be better with rye instead of bourbon.  A bit sweet, otherwise.
Week 47 (Nov 19-Nov 25): Bitter Word
    Holy bitters, Batman!  What a wonderful, clovey surprise.  Balanced...?!
Week 48 (Nov 26-Dec 2): Satan's Whiskers (curled)
    Extremely orangey, and extremely delicious.  Where has this drink been?
Week 49 (Dec 3-Dec 9): Opera
    Complex, martini-like, but sweetly so.
Week 50 (Dec 10-Dec 16): Martinez
    Cocktail recipe: gin, dry, cointreau, Angostura.  Sophisticated, a little eggnoggy.
Week 51 (Dec 17-Dec 23): Ramos Gin Gizz
    Modified Cocktail recipe.  Fun!  but probably not worth shaking 12 minutes.  Flash blend?  Like a lemon-lime orange creamsicle.
Week 52 (Dec 24-Dec 30): Christmas Martini
    Intensely minty with a Christmas touch; "like kissing a lumberjack" -John; nobody else really liked this, but f 'em :P; complexity 4

Finished!  woo!
