St. Clemens (non-alcoholic)

2 oz OJ
3/4 oz lemon juice
1/2 oz pomegranate concentrate
                                                                                Sour, but not too sour.  Sweetened only by orange juice!  (06-08-2011?)

10-04-2014: I've been making it with homemade grenadine, which also works well,
but it's nice to top it with a splash of soda in that case, to keep it from
being too sweet.  Lemon peel or orange wheel makes for a nice garnish..
