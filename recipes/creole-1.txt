Creole #1 (from Cocktail)

1-1/2 oz bourbon
1-1/2 oz sweet vermouth
1/4 oz Benedictine
1/4 oz Amer Picon (i used Bittermen's Amere Sauvage)

Garnish: lemon twist.

I'm really not sure why i didn't try this before -- it's every bit as good as
the Creole #1, unlike so many drinks named X #2.  (Or maybe it's just the
Corpse Reviver #2... would stand to reason, anyhow..)

Made 12-03-2012 for David at informal small Trevor-based cocktails, and he
rather enjoyed it.  His constraint was "bourbon-based", and i pressed for
"alcohol forward".  Very well-balanced cocktail -- not too sweet like a 1:1
Manhattan, and instead just a bit herby.

I probably never made it before because i didn't have Amer Picon.
