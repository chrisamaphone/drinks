Vesper (tweaked from Cocktail)

2 oz gin
1 oz vodka
1/2 oz Cocchi Americano

*Shake* over ice.  Garnish with a lemon twist.

10-20-2012: Made this with Chris, maybe for my first time?  Apparently, Cocchi
Americano is a lot closer to the original Kina Lillet than today's Lillet Blanc
is.  I *love* Cocchi Americano -- it's like a blanc vermouth that's bitter in
that wonderful Campari way -- almost like a pre-mixed Americano!  But subtler.
Not so much of the weird, white-winey sour-grapey dryness i associate with a lot
of dry vermouths.

Anyway, the Cocchi made it a really wonderful drink.  We used Hayman's Old Tom
gin at Chris's request, and the malty-sweetness complemented the Cocchi well, i
think.  (Any strong gin would do well, but offer its own character.)  This is
actually a pretty nice drink!

A couple mods from various "canons":

    (1) Cocktail says to stir, but i went back to the James Bond preparation of
    shaking the bastard, so it comes out ice cold and cloudy, and i think it's
    actually really pretty that way as a sort of "martini variation"

    (2) Cocktail suggests a 2-1-1/2, and i did stick with that in favor of the
    James Bond original 3-1-1/2 -- i wanted to be able to taste the Cocchi
    Americano, and i thought it might be lost with 3 oz of gin.  Worth a shot
    sometime, though -- might fill the wine glass better.

    (3) Cocktail suggests an orange twist, but bollocks to that -- lemon goes
    better with the Cocchi, i think.  (Maybe orange complements today's Lillet
    better...?)
