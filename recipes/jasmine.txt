Jasmine (from Cocktail)

1.5 gin
.25 Cointreau
.25 Campari
.75 lemon juice

Tastes deliciously like grapefruit juice!  Surprisingly sweet for its
ingredients, but no one ingredient stands out.  Is this the prototype
of the Death's Comeback?  Though in hindsight, Death's Comeback has
got to be waaay sweeter.

Similar to a Pegu, but bitters -> Campari and lime -> lemon.

Wonder if Chris would like this one -- it's not just fruit juice, but
it's not overly alcoholic, somehow!

Featured at Womcave Carnival Cocktails 2012, 04-21-2012.  Amelie (Maya's
current girlfriend) wanted something pink, but "she's an accomplished
drinker", which said "sophisticated" to me.  This was perfect for her.
Also, Matt Mets got one and i told him the story of Matt Jasmine.  Heh.


Zuccmine (variation)

1-1/2 oz gin
3/4 oz lemon juice (or 1/2 for a drier cocktail)
1/4 oz Cointreau
1/4 oz Rabarbaro Zucca

i.e., just a Jasmine with Zucca instead of Campari -- makes for a really sour
Jasmine with a nice peach color.  Or drop the lemon juice down to 1/2 oz for a
pleasantly dry, more balanced potation (maybe too balanced?).  More Cointreau
was determined not to help -- too sweet.  Invented (if such can be said of this
drink at all) at womcave cocktails Saturday 03-28-2015 with 8, Matt, Akiva,
Lizzie, Chris, and Rob in attendance.
