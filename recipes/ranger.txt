Ranger (from Cocktail)

1 oz rum
1 oz gin
1/2 oz lemon juice
1 dash simple syrup

Garnish: lemon twist

Very simple refreshing drink.  The dash of simple isn't enough to make it sweet,
but it's enough to make it not overpoweringly sour or strong.  Also adds a nice
mouthfeel (channeling Jamie Boudreau here).

Choice of gin makes a huge difference.  I thought about it quite a bit, almost
grabbing for the Hayman's Old Tom, but i decided to go vegetal and grabbed the
Martin Miller's instead, as i'd remembered it making one of our gin-forward
drinks *really* tasty -- the Bronx River as it turns out, an excellent-sounding
drink which i should return to!  And one that's not too far off from this:
mostly alcohol, a bit of lemon juice, a bit of simple -- but the Bronx River
with a bit of sweet vermouth, too, making it a lovely aperitif.

But enough about that -- i'm talking about the Ranger here.  It's simple and
delicious, with Martin Miller's.  I do think the Old Tom would work well, too,
making a richer, sweeter drink while still being complex and interesting.  The
gin rather stands out here, making me wonder if this was a good rum study drink
after all -- but maybe the interaction is sufficiently unique, the rum bringing
out the sweeter notes in everything, even the lemon juice.

05-14-2013 when i first made this.  For what it's worth, i flamed the lemon
peel -- i can't be stopped.  Not as much flame this time; i think the lemons
are getting a bit too old.
