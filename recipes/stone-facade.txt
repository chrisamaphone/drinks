Stone Facade (invented Wed, 06-19-2013 in SF at 8's apartment)

1-1/2 oz St. George's Botanivore gin
3/4 oz Amaro Ciociaro
1/4 oz Fernet-Branca
2 dashes Aztec xocolatl bitters

Invented to use Amaro Ciociaro in a cocktail.  The botanicals helped temper the
natural sweetness of the Ciociaro, while the bitters helped emphasize its
spiciness.  The Fernet, as usual, tied things together -- mintiness pairing both
with herbals and with chocolate.

I wonder if tequila, or even mezcal, could have worked better.  Or maybe just a
different gin.  Martin Miller's basil sharpness, maybe?  Or would that be too
sweet?

Mindi helped name it -- the first flavor sensation that came to her was "stone".
Cool, earthy, grounded.
